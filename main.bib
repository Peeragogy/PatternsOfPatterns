abstract = {This article looks back over a decade of futures work. It looks at the development of critical futures study, at several key premises and some outcomes in terms of teaching, research and other products. From this perspective aspects of the wider field are then briefly discussed. One proposition is that futures study and research do constitute a true discipline (or metadiscipline) for scholarly enquiry. While the field still suffers from earlier weaknesses, it has continued to develop and is likely to achieve wider acceptance and application. A second proposition is that for such acceptance to take place it will need to incorporate approaches which deal with continuity and change at a range of levels. The need to communicate difficult issues clearly is a continuing challenge. A critical futures method provides some of the necessary tools.}
