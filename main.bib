abstract = {This paper presents the results of an innovative pilot experiment on elaborating transformative energy scenarios by using a causal layered analysis (CLA) game. CLA is an integrative and communicative method, which divides issues into four layers: litany, systemic causes, worldviews, and metaphors. In the piloted CLA game, four existing scenario drafts from the Neo-Carbon Energy project: “Radical Startups”, “Value-Driven Techemoths”, “Green DIY Engineers” and “New Consciousness” were used. The CLA game session, as depicted in this paper, worked through the CLA layers sequentially per each scenario, contributed new elements to the scenario narratives, and utilised roleplay for the worldview and metaphor layers. This CLA game highlighted the complexity, polyphony and actor dynamics of the future worlds. We identify four key benefits: developing the CLA game scenario methodology, gaming-based social learning, deepening of sociocultural energy scenario drafts and exploration of energy transformation toward renewable energy based futures. As a new type of CLA workshop, the game expanded the method's boundaries. Recommendations are presented for developing serious gaming further in scenario processes.}

abstract = {This article looks back over a decade of futures work. It looks at the development of critical futures study, at several key premises and some outcomes in terms of teaching, research and other products. From this perspective aspects of the wider field are then briefly discussed. One proposition is that futures study and research do constitute a true discipline (or metadiscipline) for scholarly enquiry. While the field still suffers from earlier weaknesses, it has continued to develop and is likely to achieve wider acceptance and application. A second proposition is that for such acceptance to take place it will need to incorporate approaches which deal with continuity and change at a range of levels. The need to communicate difficult issues clearly is a continuing challenge. A critical futures method provides some of the necessary tools.}

abstract = {A computational model for the organization of design precedent knowledge is developed. The model is composed of distinct chunks of knowledge called design stories. A formalism for the design story is proposed which represents the linkage between design issue, concept and form in designs. Stories are structured in memory according to a semantic network. The lexicon of the semantic network acts as a memory index. The memory structure and indexing system are demonstrated to enhance search and to support cross-contextual browsing and exploration in the precedent library. The approach is demonstrated in a pilot design aid system in the task domain of early conceptual design in architecture.}
