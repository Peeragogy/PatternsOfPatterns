:END:
We introduce Inayatullah’s Causal Layered Analysis method from the
field of futures studies into the domain of patterns.  We elaborate
some “CLA patterns” and apply them to think about the future of the
pattern theory.  We develop a case study that uses CLA together with
patterns in collaborative research, and discuss implications for other
research and innovation projects.
* Introduction
In 1999, Christopher Alexander discussed the future of the pattern
theory with an audience of programmers cite:alexander1999a.  Here, we
revisit the questions he asked using an established technique from
future studies.  The contribution in this paper is both methodological
— demonstrating how future studies and patterns methods can be combine
— and also constructively-critical, since when the analysis we develop
points to issues that the design pattern community will wish to
consider as it shapes its own further development.

** Outline of Methods

In Section [[methods]], we detail three techniques which can help a
community carry out self-evaluation and peer learning.  Each any of
these techniques provides of value independently, but we propose that,
used in tandem, they complement each other synergetically, and
overcome shortcomings of using one or more of these techniques in
isolation.  The methods, in outline, are as follows.

*The first technique is the Peeragogy Action Review (PAR).* It is
structured around five questions which members of the community
discuss and answer, typically soon after an event such as a meeting or
working session.  This produces a record of the event as seen through
the eyes of the participants and of their evaluation of what
transpired.

*The second technique is Causal Layered Analysis (CLA).*  This is a
research methodology which is based on examining a subject at the four
levels of litany, system, worldview and myth using techniques from
poststructuralism. macrohistory, and postcolonial multicultural
theory.  The goal is to achieve a deep and inclusive undertanding by
integrating empiricist, interpretative, critical, and action
knowledge.

*The third technique is Design Pattern Languages (DPL).* Design patterns
present solutions to recurring problems in a way that can be combined
with other patterns and adapted to different situations.  Taken
together, design pattens form a common language which a community can
use to discuss matters of design and serve as a repository of shared
knowledge.

Each of the three methods adds a diffferent element to the mix:

# empirical, depth of analysis, actionability to overcome a sense of being stuck at the level of problems !
# Maybe if you add this

# CONTEXT, PROBLEM, SOLUTION — how do you actually write a pattern? Not just ‘running a workshop’

- PAR provides the /sensory element/ of systematically gathered
  observational data and verification.  Thus, our analyses are more
  likely to be grounded in reality and we remain open to learning new
  things and being surprised by novelties and anomalies we discover in
  the data.  We can continually check how effective our design
  patterns are in practice and revise them accordingly.

- CLA adds the /cognitive element/ of organization and depth to the
  enterprise.  Before we incorporated this technique, we were in
  danger of getting lost and tripping over ourselves in a pile of PAR
  reports and design patterns.  CLA-based meta-review provided the
  metaphorical bones and discursive joints for assembling these
  disjecta membra into a coherent body of self-knowledge.  By
  critically re-examining the notions of problem, solution, and
  context implicit in pattern language, CLA facilitates more effecive
  use of design patterns and helps avoid muddles such as designing a
  technological solution to what, upon deeper consideration, turns out
  to be a fundamentally social issue or vice-versa.

- DPL adds the /motor element/ of action planning, orchestration, and enactment.
  Having carefully analyzed the situation and determined what to do
  next and where to act, we need to plot a course of action that takes
  into account the complexities of the situation and is suited to our
  particular circumstances.

** Summary of Findings

In Section [[Figure]], we focus in on the project planning and management
techniques of a trandisciplinary research seminar that studies the
Emacs editor.  We show how we have used PARs, CLA, and DPL, to develop
a sense of direction for our research, and to allow our work to
interoperate well with related efforts.  This case study provides a
detailed practical example that other projects across the pattern
language space may wish to emulate (or adapt) in their settings.

In Section [[Ground]], we use CLA to survey and analyse design patterns
methods more broadly.  DPL provide a general-purpose design
methodology cite:Corneli2018: however, the high-level evolution of
this method in response to criticism, innovation, technical
developments, and long-term cultural change has not been previously
studied in an integrated manner.  Causal Layered Analysis allows us to
surface the direction of travel of pattern language methods, drawing
on foundational literature and empirical observation.  We identify
trends within the pattern discourse towards transdisciplinary thinking
and large-scale collaboration; and we connect Alexander’s views on
wholeness with the evolution of Western philosophical thought.  This
in turn has implications for the way we think about pattern languages.

** Outline of Implications

In Section [[Discussion]], we look back over the case study and survey, to
draw out some implications for the future of design patterns.
Specifically, we look at how these methods have been applied
(separately) to the well-established problem of anthropogenic climate
change.  We suggest that the integrated strategy we propose could lead
to more satisfactory outcomes on problems at this scale.  We then
develop four scenarios for the possible future development of
pattern-theoretic methods.  In Section, [[Conclusion]] we present a PAR
for the paper as a whole: this is offered as an example of a potential
‘best practice’ for pattern authors, on the view that widespread
adoption of this method would help improve collaboration within the
design patterns community.

* Methods
<<methods>>
** Design Patterns
Let’s begin by setting to one side any specialist notion of ‘patterns’
that we may have in mind, and think about patterns in a fundamental
way.  Some patterns repeat in /space/, some in /time/, some in both /space
and time/: a tiling, a beat, a wave.  In the physical world, it would
seem that patterns cannot repeat exactly, or forever.  The elements
that comprise a pattern are subject to spatial or temporal
displacement, and other forms of variation.

Let’s explore the notion of ‘design pattern’ starting from this
foundation.  Leitner supplied the following summary: "[Design]
Patterns are shared as complete methodic descriptions intended for
practical use by experts and non-experts" \citep{leitner2015a}.  As we
look into the matter further, two central features emerge.  Like an
ellipse, the concept of the design pattern has two main foci: context
and community.
# [fn:: An ellipse is the set of all points in a plane such that the sum of their distances from two fixed points is a constant.]

- /Context/ shapes and constrains the type of activity which is being considered, such as designing a building, or writing software.
- /Community/ encompasses the stakeholders --- experts and non-experts alike --- who are involved with or affected by a particular project.

Integral to the basic concept of a design pattern is a third feature
that describes the interaction of the community and the context.  The
community uses the pattern to overcome some real or potential /conflict/
that they experience within this context.  The conflict is also
referred to as a /problem/; its resolution is described as a /solution/.

Alexander and Poyner emphasised that ‘design’ is not needed when the
conflict can be resolved in an obvious or straightforward manner.  For
example, you typically would not need a design process surrounding
/sitting in a chair/, because “under normal conditions each one of the
tendencies which arises in this situation can take care of itself”
\citep[p.~311]{alexander1970a}.

All of this means that design patterns need to achieve something
fairly subtle.  Each represents the synthesis of a repeatable solution
to a type of conflict which itself repeats within a particular
context.  Furthermore, it does this a way that makes the solution
teachable, learnable, and otherwise replicable within a given
community.  However, if the design pattern makes the solution to the
problem too obvious, then “design”, /per se/, is no longer needed![fn::
For example, Peter Norvig argued that we see fewer of the design
patterns typical of object oriented programs inside programs written
in functional and dynamic languages, because these languages embed
many of the typical patterns as language features.]  Accordingly, we
might say that the design pattern carries with it a fragment of
irreducible complexity.  This perspective may or may not be
surprising.

Alexander had described the need for patterns when things get complex
cite:alexander1964notes.  He specifically focuses on what could be
called “horizontal” complexity, a situation where there are a lot of
moving parts and relations between them.  Methodologically this is
elaborated with the notion of a /pattern language/.[fn:: The issues involved become somewhat more complex when there are multiple languages, but not fundamentally different; on a procedural note,
in what follows small caps will denotes references to external patterns, whereas all-caps will denote references to patterns described in the current text.]  Pattern languages
have a property of unfolding, from more general to more specific.
However, they seem to leave open deeper forms of “vertical”
complexity, where there are deep historical or ontogenetic causes, or
complex conceptual issues, which are not readily expressible in
design-pattern-theoretic terms.  Let’s have another look at these
issues by way of two contrasting metaphors.

The first metaphor comes from Christian Kohls, who proposed to treat
each design pattern as a journey: “a path as a solution to reach a
goal” cite:kohls2010a.  In this metaphor, design patterns are
understood to have an initial condition and an end condition, defined
within some context, which also defines a cost function on traversals
of paths.  There are two problems: the more elementary problem is to
traverse the terrain and travel from the start state to the end state
at low cost; the second problem is to find a reliably repeatable way
to do this.  Once found, the low-cost path can be described to and
traversed by others.

The second metaphor comes from Joseph Campbell, who described a kind
of “archetypal pattern” cite:shalloway2005a, one that can be found
embedded in myths and stories across diverse cultures and historical
periods.  The “hero’s journey” is also typically described with a path
cite:campbell1949a, however, in this case the path runs in a circle,
and focuses on the transformations of the hero who traverses it.
Although an account of the journey can be shared, traversal is
effectively single-use.  The cost is typically “high.”
Nevertheless, once a myth or metaphor is established by way of a
shared narrative, the journey can be reenacted through ritual or
engaged with in other ways that solve a range of social problems
cite:handelman1998a.

This should suggest that Kohls’s metaphor does not fully express the
complexity that is underpins each design pattern.  It does, however,
hint at this complexity.  Design pattern creation calls out for
suitable methods, and on this basis we should expect to find patterns
for finding, writing, and discussing patterns: and, of course, we do.
However, this material does not fully explain where design patterns
come from — or where they are going to — not an an obviously graspable
way.  To really get a handle on /the future of the pattern theory/
cite:alexander1999a, we need another approach.

** Causal Layered Analysis
<<CLA_patterns>> We begin this section by introducing Inayatullah’s
cite:inayatullah1998b,inayatullah2004causal Causal Layered Analysis
(CLA) formalism by way of two examples, in Table [[tabpatterns]]: a short
motivating story that should communicate an intuitive feeling for the
four layers, and an initial brief recollection of the patterns
literature across the /surface/, /social/, /worldview/, and /myth/.  We will
develop the analysis in Table 1B in Section [[Ground]].

Why might CLA have practical relevance, beyond its current sphere of
application by futurists?  One reason, which could be familiar to the
protagonists of the story in Table 1A: “Innovation foils attempts to
be consistent and efficient” cite:tan2020uncertainty (p. 12).  The
need to understand, respond to, and sometimes to foment /change/ —
possibly rapid and thoroughgoing change — underscores the
incompleteness of Kohls’s journey metaphor.  The CLA framework is a
particularly good fit for our central objective, because it is often
used in organisations and movements to answer the question: “What is
our vision for change and how is progress measurable?”  For example,
in 1999, Alexander’s vision was that of “the generation of a living
world” cite:alexander1999a — however the exact process whereby
progress would be made towards that vision had the status of a
question.

To help make the CLA practicable as a /method/, we will now turn to five
techniques that Inayatullah refers to as the /poststructural futures
toolbox/.  Here, we rework his descriptions of these theoretical tools
using the classical design pattern format.

| $$\text{A.}\vspace{-.5cm}$$ |
| ¶1 Imagine a couple who on some of their first dates enjoy going out for pizza.  They like different toppings, but that doesn’t particularly matter, because each of them orders their own perfectly sized Neopolitan-style pizza, and eats it with gusto.  Indeed, it turns out they like pizza so much that they would like to have it several nights a week.  Going out this frequently would be expensive, so they get good at making their own pizzas at home: selecting good ingredients, fermenting the dough, and baking at a high temperature. |
| ¶2 After some time goes by, they have gotten really good at this, and they daydream about opening their own restaurant.  They look into some available practical guidance and adapt it for their use case. After a lot of planning and a whole lot of work, they get their new pizza restaurant up and running, and they are doing good business. However, as more time goes by, they begin to notice some stress. Why’s that? |
| ¶3 Imagine that one of the two was excited to pursue a vision of /self-reliance/, inspired by historical figures like Thoreau — whereas the other partner was more focused on the /quality of the food and the health of their relationship/, inspired by the contemporary Slow Food movement — along with childhood memories of parents who loved cooking together.  These days, our two protagonists hardly see each other any more!  One of them is still around the restaurant every day, greeting customers and baking — the other is off sourcing ingredients and developing relationships with others in the local food supply chain. |
| ¶4 If they realise that the challenges they face — alongside their successes to date — are driven by different but reasonably compatible values, it is likely that with due care the points of difference can be mutually supportive.  An appropriate response to the stress they are experiencing might be to reconnect with a deeper rhythm, closing the shop Monday through Wednesday, and only opening it on Thursday through Sunday.  Instead of pursuing the American Dream based on acquiring wealth, they decide to focus together on art, spirituality, and cultivating their own garden together. |

| $$\text{B.}\vspace{-.5cm}$$ |
| ¶1 The first layer in CLA is the *surface level*.  In the case of the design patterns discourse, this level includes, for example, the familiar kinds of patterns that are published in papers, discussed at PLoP, put into use in designs of various kinds, or debated by practitioners (e.g., Christopher Alexander’s “Entryway Transition” pattern, but also his remarks about how people who attempted to apply his methods ended up placing “alcoves everywhere”, etc.). This is sometimes also referred to as the *problem level*: in the patterns discourse, this is all very familar, because problems abound.  The other synonym for this layer is the *litany layer*: it describes the problems that everyone is familiar with. |
| ¶2 Beyond that, we have the *social phenomena* that cause the problems to emerge — along with the familiar solutions.  In the original setting in which patterns developed, this layer might include causes such as more people living in cities, combined with the possibility of developing a more community-driven approach to design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ¶3 The next layer beyond that comprise *worldviews* (e.g., Alexander’s view that “There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness”).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ¶4 Lastly, there are *myths or metaphors* (e.g., Alexander idea that the architect’s work is done ‘for the glory of God’ (see Galle, 2020) or his conception that ‘primitive’ dwellings contain more ‘life’).  To emphasize, CLA does not dismiss myths in the slightest: on the contrary, they are what are seen drive the other layers.  Another term that is used to characterise this layer is *narratives*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

*** DECONSTRUCTION
<<DECONSTRUCTION>>

- *Context*: A text: here meaning anything that can be critiqued — a movie, a book, a worldview, a person — something or someone that can be read.  (/NB./, every text has a /context/: much like every pattern has a context.)
- *Problem*: The existence of a ‘text’ suggests a *conflict* between (1) the notion of truth embedded in that text, and (2) the text itself as historically situated or positioned within relationships of power.
- *Solution*: We break apart the text’s components, asking what is visible and what is invisible? Who or what is privileged within or by the text? Which assuptions does the text make preferrable?  How is ‘truth’ produced within the text?  Who is silenced?  In this way, we ‘deconstruct’ the universality of the text and show its contingent nature.

*** GENEALOGY
<<GENEALOGY>>

- *Context*: History is not just the passage of time, but an unfolding of different positions. We consider a /concept/ or /idea/ to be historically situated in this sense.
- *Problem*: Within history, certain discourses have been hegemonic. A given term or concept will have developed through varied discourses: this observation *conflicts* with a naive notion of terms or concepts as simply ‘given’ or universally true.
- *Solution*: We ask: which discourses have been victorious in constituting the present? How have they travelled through history? What have been the points in which the issues have become important or contentious?  By tracing the evolution of a given term or concept through periods of identity or sameness, and through periods of difference or divergence, we come face-to-face with its generative potential.

*** DISTANCE
<<DISTANCE>>

- *Context*: The present.
- *Problem*: The present seems ‘normal’, but this *conflicts* with any impetus to change.
- *Solution*: We ask: which scenarios make the present remarkable?  Make it unfamiliar? Denaturalize it?  Where are these scenarios, e.g., are they in historical space — the futures that could have been — or in present or future space? By establishing a sense of distance from the present, we can return to explore the present from a different point of view.  We are more likely to see the ever-changing character of the present, points of leverage, and how to use them.

*** ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES
<<ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES>>

- *Context*: The past that we see as truth is in fact the particular writing of history: it is a text amenable to [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]].  The futures that we are ‘given’ are, similarly, only some of the ones that are in-principle-possible due to the evolutionary nature of concepts exposed by their [[GENEALOGY][GENEALOGY]].
- *Problem*: The past and future are put to use within discourse, resulting in some winners and some losers.  The results we see may *conflict* with our sense of what we would prefer to have happen.
- *Solution*: We ask: which interpretation of past is valorized?  What histories make the present problematic?  Which vision of the future is used to maintain the present?  Alternatively, which visions undo the unity of the present?

*** REORDERING KNOWLEDGE
<<REORDERING KNOWLEDGE>>
- *Context*: Trends and problems are emergent, historical, and political: they are embedded in complex webs of becoming.
- *Problem*: It’s not always obvious how to move /between/ the ‘layers’ mentioned above. This *conflicts* with any given effort to empower oneself with a deeper understanding of the situation.
- *Solution*: We ask: how does the ordering of knowledge differ across civilization, gender and episteme? What or Who is othered? How does it denaturalize current orderings, making them peculiar instead of universal? What tools can we use to reorder knowledge, to make it available in new forms without necessarily requiring the same historical baggage?

** PARs

Before turning to our main applications, we will introduce one more
technique — although we will not refer to it again until Section
[[Figure]].

The US Army produced a methodology called the /After Action Review/ or
AAR cite:Training-the-Force.  AARs can be used to assign
responsibility when things ‘go wrong’, and can help people figure out
how to do better next time.  It has been used effectively in business
settings cite:learning-in-the-thick-of-it.

In a more fully collaborative and distributed peer-to-peer setting, we
needed an adaptation of the AAR that made it a more open ended. We
came up with the following template:

1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
4. What did we learn or change?
5. What else should we change going forward?

When we fill in the template, we call it “doing a /PAR”/.  As an
acronym, “PAR” has stood for various things over the years —
Peeragogical Action Review, Project Action Review — but we typically
use it as a stand-alone term.  Allusively, it brigns to mind the
corresponding concept of /par/ in golf, and helps give us a sense of how
we are doing at any given point in time.[fn:: “In golf, par is the
predetermined number of strokes that a proficient golfer should
require to complete a hole, a round (the sum of the pars of the played
holes), or a tournament (the sum of the pars of each round).” —
Wikipedia] Like the Army, we typically use PARs retrospectively (so,
asking, “what /did/ we expect to learn or make together?”).  In this
sense “doing a PAR” shares some common ground with the
\textsc{Daily Scrum} and \textsc{Sprint Retrospective}
cite:sutherland2019a patterns from Scrum.  However, PARs can be used
without the product orientation of Scrum.

Indeed, PARs can also be applied to look forward,
proactively, as a way to scaffold anticipation by “remembering the future”
cite:arnkil2008remembering.  In that case, item #5 can be expanded to
include a number of different forward-looking scenarios.
Some further things to note at this stage:

- PARs are related to patterns, in that they describe a context, and
  surface problems and solutions that arise or are likely to arise in
  that context.  They might be seen as a template for proto-patterns.
  However, they do not necessarily have a strong ‘repeating’ aspect.

- Once when we have collected a suitable number of PARs, we can use
  them as data for analysis with CLA.  Metaphorically, CLA
  ‘integrates’ the ‘tangent vectors’ that characterise the
  observations we gather as we work together, to reconstruct the
  shared meaning of this work.

* Case study: Planning “Season 1” for the Emacs Research Group
<<Figure>>

This section summarises the concrete application of the methods from
Section [[methods]] within an active seminar, the Emacs Research Group,
which was convened following EmacsConf 2020.[fn::
https://emacsconf.org/2020/; the conference took place November 28th
and 29th of 2020.]  We illustrates how the three methods introduced
above interoperate.  In our case, this analysis has allowed us develop
a trajectory for the project: as a case study, it gives a reasonably
self-contained example.  We refer to work carried out up to this point
as *Season 0*, on the view that our thinking has developing
rhizomatically, underground, rather than fully in the public sphere.
As such, this analysis also constitutes a soft launch for the project,
contextualising our work relative to the PLoP and Peeragogy
communities, and the wider DPL discourse.

During 25 sessions spread over approximately half a year, we have used
CLA in combination with PARs to address the question ‘What is our
vision for change and how is progress measurable?’.  More
specifically: we did a PAR at the end of every (approximately weekly,
two-hour) session.[fn:: Data archived at
https://github.com/exp2exp/exp2exp.github.io, with meeting notes and
PARs indexed and viewable on the web at
https://exp2exp.github.io/erg.]  This allowed us to track progress,
and to surface key issues and concerns.  Then, every six weeks or so,
we merged selected bullet-points from these PARs into the CLA outline,
depending on which section they seemed to fit best.  We then jointly
elaborated those bullet points into a narrative form, and began to
develop TODO items that would make the /next steps/ for this seminar
group both actionable and meaningful.[fn:: The Peeragogy approach to
patterns is aligned with the feminist principle is that /all knowledge
is incomplete/
(https://mitpress.podbean.com/e/experiments-in-open-peer-review/,
minute 5).  A “living” patterns is attached to next steps that would
help to realise the pattern within a context; when we don’t have any
next steps, we put the pattern in a \textsc{Scrapbook}.]  We collate
these next steps with known peeragogy design patterns like
\textsc{Roadmap} cite:peeragogy-handbook-long.[fn:: See
http://peeragogy.org/top for a reworking of the /Peeragogy Handbook/ as
a unified pattern language, which extends the earlier presentation in
cite:patterns-of-peeragogy.] We elaborate new patterns where there is no match
for our current needs; one per CLA section: [[FORMALISE][FORMALISE]], [[SERENDIPITY][SERENDIPITY]],
[[RECOMMENDER][RECOMMENDER]] and [[DIVERSITY][DIVERSITY]].  We also cross-reference each of the TODO
items with the most closely associated patterns from the
poststructural futures toolbox from Section [[CLA_patterns]].  This shows
how the lines of thinking that underpins the CLA can inform further
action.

** Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change)

We’ve made progress since we started with the raw themes of *Research
on/in/with Emacs* back in December 2020.  We’ve met almost every week
since then, and interviewed some interesting and varied guests.  We
have a clearer idea of what what we want to talk about at the next
EmacsConf, and how we can be of service to researchers and Emacs
users.  We have been using a workflow that helps us carefully review
progress, diagnose issues, and manage our energy.  The next phase of
this project is to “go public” and mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere, including by getting some training events up and
running.

*** FORMALISE
<<FORMALISE>>
- *Context*: In our work with project- and change-management
  \textsc{Technologies} across a widely distributed
  \textsc{Community}.
- *Problem*: Using patterns, todo items, CLA, and PARs in an intuitive
  manner is clearly workable at a small scale, but could become
  chaotic when we scale up; this *conflicts* with our perspective that
  these methods can be applied broadly.
- *Solution*: Can we develop a more mathematically precise way to
  describe this set of tools?  We might build on the earlier work of
  Corneli et al. cite:Corneli2018 which describes patterns as
  /conceptual blends/.
** Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)

If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration.  We like to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal
articles).  However, “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be
research” — therefore, we’re focusing initially on /research methods/
and /design documents/.  That may mean it takes us a bit longer to write
our first paper, but when we get something out it will be good.
Meanwhile we’re also keeping sharp by fixing bugs, filing issues,
improving our own workflows, and actively exploring the landscape.  We
want to keep a role for serendipity here, which adds the requirement
that our planning process remain open and flexible: including to
various disciplinary methods, and especially to change as we reflect
on how things are going.

*** TODO Identify potential stakeholders in Emacs Research       :Community:

some [[GENEALOGY][GENEALOGY]]; we pursue that in Section [[Ground]].

#   encountering the unexpected
By expecting the unexpected we [[DISTANCE][DISTANCE]] ourselves somewhat from
current circumstances; see further details in the [[SERENDIPITY][SERENDIPITY]] pattern.
*** SERENDIPITY
<<SERENDIPITY>>
- *Context*: Within an ongoing research and development project.
- *Problem*: The idea of planning *conflicts* with our experience that
  reliance on plans can produce rigid behaviour and a corresponding
  brittleness.
- *Solution*: We adapt our plans to increase our /general/ preparedness, and adapt our strategy to decrease our reliance on accurate /forecasting/. This operationalises the ‘serendipity pattern’ described by Merton.[fn:: “The serendipity pattern refers to the fairly common experience of observing an unanticipated, anomalous and strategic datum which becomes the occasion for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory… ” cite:merton1948bearing, reprinted in cite:merton.]

** Worldview, ways of knowing and alternative discourse

We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can learn from and eventually improve upon.
‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as,
respectively, ‘more bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualising
things.  Concretely, we’ve been studying our own processes and looking
for the tools and settings that are the most conducive to the work we
want to do.  For example, instead of having a single Org Roam
directory shared via Git, what if we had ways of managing sharing of
notes across ‘graphs’?

Collaboration is familiar to in all kinds of teams across all sectors.
Even authors working alone may have need to ‘virtually collaborate
with themselves’ — and of course to share their work with others when
it’s ready.  If we all had our slipboxes online, we could reference
between them.  This would generalise *ORCiD*, and people to reference
processes that are undergoing evolution.  Maybe a service like this
would turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’ — helping to match people
based on their interests (or similar people in different fields).  So,
what’s the price point?  Instead of paying money to go to conferences,
now we can spontaneously make conferences and workshops.  As a guess,
$750.0 per user per year might be a fair price — for those who can
afford to pay it — if the service helps people to do better research
and saves a bunch of travel.  We could also set up a pricing model
proportional to each country’s carbon emissions or something like
that.

*** RECOMMENDER
<<RECOMMENDER>>
- *Context*: Within our use of \textsc{Technologies} and materials we
  could \textsc{Reduce, reuse, recycle}.
- *Problem*: As the body of content grows, it can be harder to find
  relevant material or the best collaborators in a global pool: this
  *conflicts* with our desire to achieve excellence.
- *Solution*: New software that can help surface relevant material and
  opportunities would be useful.  Existing implementations include
  “scrobbling” on Last.fm or buying recommended products on Amazon.
  The same ideas can be adapted to free/libre/open source contents,
  research, learning, and other domains.
** Myths, metaphors and narratives: imagined (longer term change)

In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘[[https://longtermist.substack.com/][long-term
perspective]]’.  This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking.  For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many cases the relevance of a given
innovation goes down over time.  However, Emacs has an evolutionary
character that has allowed it to keep up with the times — becoming
more relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to
systematise [[https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html][Editor MACroS]] for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO)
program.  Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the social
setting in which this work is done.  Whereas the concepts underlying
the free software movement were based on “[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html][communal sharing]]” of source
code, these methods can be extended and allow us to synthesise new
relationships within broader semiotic commons.  Emacs can become part
of a system for addressing large-scale existential problems, by
expanding the frontier of what’s possible for human beings.

*** DIVERSITY
<<DIVERSITY>>
- *Context*: Within a \textsc{Project}.
- *Problem*: If we only collaborate within a relatively homogeneous
  population of people who think like us this *conflicts* with our
  desire to find new ideas and new solutions, and to make things that
  are widely useful.  Sometimes, diversity is absent for seemingly
  contigent historical reasons, rather than as a design principle,
  e.g., within free software only about 5% of the participants are
  female, whereas women occupy around 25% of computing occupations
  cite:Vedres2019.
- *Solution*: Look our for difference contexts in which we can
  collaborate with different people; they don’t all have to work on
  the same project.  We recognise that collaboration is easier when we
  share similar languages and literacies.  In cases where
  collaboration needs to be made tighter, prefer ways of exchanging
  information and expertise with \textsc{Newcomers} that makes the
  relationship one of peers rather than a one-way hierarchy.

* Ground: Surveying the Pattern Languages literature
<<Ground>>

With the tools from Section [[methods]] at our disposal, and an
awareness of how they have been concretely applied within
Section [[Figure]], we now turn to a CLA of the /design patterns
community/.  We draw on DPL to assist us in this analysis,
namely the patterns from Section [[CLA_patterns]]; but we omit
PARs.  Future developments building on this analysis might
bring them back in, along with TODO items and connections to
other patterns, as shown in the previous section.

** Litany: Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change)

Recall that the litany is also referred to as the ‘problem’ layer.
The pattern community is comfortable with problems: a ‘problematizing’
view of reality is one of the main features of the design pattern
method.  However, there are a range of problems that the community is
familiar with which are not fully solved.  For example, ‘Alexander's
Problem’, as described by his collaborator Greg Bryant:

#+begin_quote
... despite all of the tools he created, his penetrating research, his
many well-wrought projects, and his excellent writing, he did not
manage to grant, to his readers, the core sensibility that drove the
work. He also did not organize the continuance of the research program
that revolves around this sensibility. cite:bryant2015
#+end_quote
Coming at similar issues from a different direction, Alexander framed
a related query for programmers using pattern methods:
#+begin_quote
What is the Chartres of programming? What task is at a high enough
level to inspire people writing programs, to reach for the stars?
cite:alexander1999a
#+end_quote
These are some of the high-level problems that are known and discussed
in the patterns community, but which do not necessarily have consensus
answers.  More recently, Dawes and Ostwald cite:dawes2017a develop an
elegant taxonomy of existing criticisms of the pattern method.  In
outline, their taxonomy covers criticisms at the following three
layers:
- Conceptualisation :: Ontology, Epistemology \newline /(e.g., “Rejecting pluralistic values confuses subjective and objective phenomena”)/
- Development and documentation :: Reasoning, Testing, Scholarship \newline\hfill /(e.g., “The definitions of ‘patterns’ and ‘forces’ are inexplicit”)/
- Implementation and outcomes :: Controlling, Flawed, Unsuccessful \newline\hfill /(e.g., “Patterns disallow radical solutions”)/

By showing how the criticisms relate to one another, Dawes and Ostwald
begin to develop a [[GENEALOGY][GENEALOGY]] at the level of critical perspectives.
At the very least the critiques they examine show that there is not just
one pattern discourse, but many.  In a parallel work the same authors analyse
the structure of /A Pattern Language/, and develop three alternative perspectives on
/APL/'s contents, which they refer to as the *generalised*, *creator*, and
*user* perspectives cite:Dawes2018.  These perspectives amount to different techniques
for [[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE][REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]].  We will elaborate at the next level.

** System: Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)

At this level, we examine where the familiar problems come from.
Using graph-theoretic measures Dawes and Ostwald cite:Dawes2018 found
that:

- The creator model appears to be /less intelligible/ than the user model, while
- The creator’s perspective of the language is /more beautiful/.

Their central finding, however, is that many patterns in which
Alexander had medium or low confidence in fact occupy a relatively
central position in /APL/'s graph:

#+begin_quote
the patterns which are most likely to be encountered by designers –
are most easily accessed, or provide greatest access to other patterns
– might be those which Alexander acknowledged were incapable of
providing fundamental solutions to the problems they addressed.
#+end_quote

This means that novice users could be expected to encounter problems
in application of /APL/'s patterns: “despite its often authoritative and
dogmatic tone, Alexander’s text was framed as a work in progress,
rather than a definitive design guide” (p. 22).  Dawes and Ostwald
suggest that their analysis could point to “prime opportunities to
continue the development of /A Pattern Language/'' (p. 21).

Here, however, a range of issues more closely linked to software and
media begin to crop up.  There are a range of ‘other’ pattern
discourses which could be relevant here — ‘other’ in the sense
mentioned in our [[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE][REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]] pattern, so not necessarily in
close touch with PLoP — these include PurPLSoc and the world of
practicing architects.  There have been some attempts at creating
systematic archives of patterns, but these have always had significant
buy-in from a wide community.

Importantly, the first-ever Wiki was developed in connection with a
platform for developing, sharing, and revising pattern languages
cite:cunningham2013a.[fn::
http://wiki.c2.com/?PeopleProjectsAndPatterns][fn::
http://c2.com/ppr/] However, there was a distinction between the
discussions and the finished patterns.  In the 2013 retrospective,
Ward Cunningham writes:
#+begin_quote
The original wiki technology functioned in a direct open-source mode,
which allowed individuals to contribute small pieces to incrementally
improve the whole.
#+end_quote
This is true if by “open source” we understand /what you see when you click Edit/ — but
the term is misleading relative to contemporary usage, which is usually linked with
the Open Source Initiative’s definition, and centred on the premise that
“Open source doesn’t just mean access to the source code.”[fn:: https://opensource.org/osd]
On the c2 wiki, licensing was restrictive. Discussions were to take place in “letters and replies” rather than revision or annotation of the published patterns; rights associated with the finished patterns were closely guarded.[fn::
http://c2.com/ppr/titles.html][fn:: http://c2.com/ppr/about/copyright.html]

Although Wiki technology could in principle have been a site for
ongoing [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]] of patterns, this didn’t seem to happen on c2.
This is itself interesting and worth deconstructing a bit.  Notably, there were only /four/ published “letters and
replies”.[fn:: http://c2.com/ppr/letters/index.html]  Unfortunately,
we could not find a public archive of the “design patterns mailing
list” where further discussions took place.  This is certainly
suggestive of contingency.

Over the years, other issues and concerns came to the fore.
Jenifer Tidwell’s charges against the Gang of Four (alongside other
developer-centric pattern languages) resonate with what we saw in
Dawes and Ostwald, above:

#+begin_quote
... the reality of a software artifact that the developer sees is not
the only one that's important.  What about the user's reality?  Why
has that been ignored in all the software patterns work that's been
done?  Isn't the user's experience the ultimate reason for designing a
building or a piece of software?  If that's not taken into account,
how can we say our building -- or our software -- is “good”? — http://www.mit.edu/~jtidwell/gof_are_guilty.html
#+end_quote

Notice that now the /user/ of the designed artefact has entered the
story as a different figure from the user of the pattern language,
whom we met above.  Tidwell’s critique suggests at least a
couple [[ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND
 FUTURES][ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES]]: e.g., what if the end-user had been
placed at the centre the whole time?  Alternatively, what if the
primary focus of patterns was to facilate interaction between
different stakeholders?  The fact that Tidwell’s book
cite:tidwell2010designing and an essay by Jans Borchers cite:borchers2008pattern
which drew inspiration from her critique both have over
1000 citations on Google Scholar shows that Tidwell’s perspective has
been impactful.  To get a sense of how the pattern community may have
been informed by this critique — along with related trends and concerns — we can look at
how the writers workshops at PLoP have evolved over time.  In Table [[tabplop]] a
selection of titles of workshop sessions show how the focus of PLoP evolved from
primarily ‘programming’ oriented to a much broader contextual view
over time.  Indeed, by 2019, the focus is almost exclusively ‘contextual’.

** Worldview: ways of knowing and alternative discourse

The situation with licensing on c2 is particularly interesting in
light of Alexander’s perspective that /APL/ was a “living language”.  In
principle, Wiki technology might have presented the opportunity to
realise this vision fully for the first time, in a virtual setting.
Wiki technology did become widely influential when it was combined
with a free content license on Wikipedia (originally GNU FDL, later
CC-By-SA).

Fast-forwarding to the present day, Christopher Alexander’s website
=patternlanguage.com= writes about [[https://www.patternlanguage.com/membership/memberstour3-struggle.html][The Struggle for People to be Free]] —
but it is not referencing freedom in the GNU sense.

In 1979 he was concerned: “Instead of being widely shared, the pattern
languages which determine how a town gets made becomes specialized and
private.”  In 2021, /APL/ itself is only legally available for
subscribers or for people who purchase a paper copy of the book. (Or
through a library!)  Of course, like many famous texts it can also be obtained
extra-legally for download as a PDF: but that format does not afford
downstream users the opportunity to collaborate on the text’s further
development.

Gabriel and Goldman talk about sharing and ‘gift culture’ in their
essay [[https://dreamsongs.com/MobSoftware.html][Mob Software: The Erotic Life of Code]], and discuss a way of
working that seems to bring back the early days of hacker culture.
(Notably, this essay was presented as a keynote talk at the same
programming conference where Alexander had spoken four years
previously.)  They reference the open source community — but not the
free software community, so we will follow Gabriel and Goldman’s usage
here — as the origin of Mob Software.

#+begin_quote
Because the open source proposition asked the crucial first question,
I include it in what I am calling “mob software,” but mob software
goes way beyond what open source is up to today.
#+end_quote

That “crucial first question” is: “What if what once was scarce is now abundant?”
It is well known that the PLoP conference series builds on this idea: it includes
shepherding and workshops cite:gabriel2002a as well as games, informal gifts, and
other measures that aim to create a sense of psychological safety: indeed, the central issue of
making a space where ‘failure’ is OK and even celebrated, as per Mob
Software. The essay develops its own criticisms of open source, e.g.,
“the open-source community is extremely conservative” and forking
happens rarely.  (Five years later, with the creation of Git, forking
became considerably more typical.)  Resonating with Tidwell’s critique
from above:

#+begin_quote
One difference between open source and mob software is that open
source topoi are technological while mob software topoi are people
centered.
#+end_quote

On a technical basis, Gabriel’s vision sounds a lot like today’s world
of /microservices/.
While his vision hasn’t fully come to pass — there are still many
services with proprietary source code — nowadays many big companies
are also big proponents of open source.  Here we can notice that
Gabriel was employing a technique of imagining [[ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES][ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND
FUTURES]], e.g., he imagined a future in which:

#+begin_quote
Mentoring circles and other forms of workshop are the mainstay of
software development education. There are hundreds of millions of
programmers.
#+end_quote

We would like to dig somewhat deeper into the foundations of the
worldview that Gabriel puts forth in this essay. Usefully, an article
by VanDrunen “traces the source of Gabriel’s ideas by examining the
authorities he cites and how he uses them and evaluates their validity
on their own terms” cite:vandrunenchristian.  His critique functions
as a (detailed) [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]] of the thinking behind Gabriel’s essay.
Some key excerpts appear in Table [[tabone]].

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

** Myths: metaphors and narratives (longer term change)

VanDrunen surfaced various concepts in Gabriel’s essay that would be
at home at this level, for example, the concept of duende that Gabriel
takes over from Garcia Lorca originally derives from /dueño de casa/,
the name of a certain kind of household spirit.  VanDrunen’s critique
is also useful for our purposes because it points to the importance of
considering the deeper layers in developing a concept.  It’s not just
a matter of finding a culture’s myths: where may also be a conflict at
this level.

One important narrative for the pattern discourse is in plain view
within the terminology of problems and solutions, which come from
mathematics or physics.  Alexander’s worked /at the level of narrative/
to connect the patterns discoures to a scientific worldview, seeking a
sense of objectivity.  For example, in “The Atoms of Environmental
Structure”:

#+begin_quote
most designers ... say that the environment cannot be right or wrong
in any objective sense but that it can only be judged according to
criteria, or goals, or policies, or values, which have themselves been
arbitrarily chose.  We believe this point of view is mistaken.
#+end_quote

Notice that, here, the discourse is position as different from the
mainstream.  The key differentiator is not the language of problems
and solutions which would be familiar to anyone with an engineering
background; rather, but in a certain notion of /wholeness/.  Which
notion of wholeness remains to be surfaced.  Quoting, again, from “The
Atoms of Environmental Structure”:

#+begin_quote
We believe that all values can be replaced by one basic value:
everything desirable in life can be described in terms of freedom of
people’s underlying tendencies. ... The environment should give free
rein to all tendencies; conflicts between people’s tendencies must be
eliminated.
#+end_quote

Historically, there are at two major varieties of wholeness: one that
is based on progressive differentiation (perhaps understood as
unfolding from substance, per Spinoza), and the other generated by
interaction between components (perhaps that of mutually reflecting
monads, per Leibniz).  In support of these allusions, a quote of
Alexander from TNO: it “may be best if we redefine the concept of God
in a way that is more directly linked to the concept of ‘the whole.’”
This sounds a lot like Spinoza![fn:: Cf. cite:lord2020 for more on the theme of Spinoza and architecture.]

Can obtain some useful [[DISTANCE][DISTANCE]] by thinking about how different kinds
of wholeness are associated with different symbols. In terms of
metaphors, we have already encountered overt images like that of
Chartres cathedral.  If we allow ourselves to explore further afield,
other symbols of wholeness come to mind: these include the circle, the
cross — or potentially the cross inside a circle,
\begingroup\alch\symbol{"3B}\endgroup.[fn:: The alchemical symbol for
verdigris, and the planetary symbol for Earth.]  Related but more
elaborated symbols include the circle with a cross rising above it
(\varTerra) which is both the modern astronomical symbol for Earth and
also linked with the Carthusian order (/Stat crux dum volvitur orbis/:
the cross is steady while the world turns) — the Rod of Asclepius
(\Asclepius, for the deity associated with healing or making whole) —
this last symbol sometimes being inter-confused with the Caduceus
(\Caduceus, the symbol of Hermes, the deity assocated with mediation
of various forms, and also echoed in the planetary symbol for Mercury,
\begingroup\alch\symbol{"53}\endgroup).

These symbols are useful map-markers for the landscape we are
exploring.  In short, the pattern discourse seems to be drawn to /both/
major traditions of wholeness: and also to seek to unite them.  We get
the idea of unfolding in /APL/ and other pattern languages that work in
a top-down manner: however, we also get the notion of patterns and
principles that are generative of emergent phenomena.  As we mentioned
above, at this level, architecture and programming were seen, by
Alexander cite:alexander1999a, to unite: here pointing in the
direction of bio-hacking and nanotechnology (e.g., for molecular
self-assembly)[fn:: Cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peripheral]
— at least at the allusive level if not at the concrete level.

Relevant to the overall case we are making here, the following
quote suggests we are on a fruitful track:
#+begin_quote
Generative patterns work indirectly; they work on the underlying
structure of a problem (which may not be manifest in the problem)
rather than attacking the problem directly.[fn:: https://wiki.c2.com/?GenerativePattern]
#+end_quote

Clearly, another key metaphor in the discourse is the metaphor of /a language/:
#+begin_quote
... as in the case of natural languages, the pattern language is
generative. It not only tells us the rules of arrangement, but shows
us how to construct arrangements - as many as we want - which satisfy
the rules. (at /ibid./, quoting from /The Timeless Way Of Building/, pp. 185-6)
#+end_quote
Indeed, the prominence of linguistic metaphors reminds us that
Alexander’s writing contains many further traces of symbols asociated
with Hermes:
#+begin_quote
In the house, [Hermes’] place is at the door, protecting the
threshold... He could be found around city gates, intersections, state
borders, and tombs (the gateways to the other world). cite:benvenuto1993hermes
#+end_quote
At the time when Hermes was actively embraced as a deity, he was
typically paired with Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, whose “domain
was internal, the closed, the fixed, the inward” (/ibid./)  The discourse
around patterns certainly contains aspects a movement “to archaic
roots” present in other 20th Century thought: but unlike some of
these, patterns methods are apparently working to restore “the
dialectic between centripital immobility and centrifugal mutation.”
One aspect of this is a movement towards foundations (in the form of
fundamental princples, per /ANO/): these are associated with Hestia.
The resolution within pattern language — as a form — seems to be along
Nietzschean lines: “anything that is becoming returns” (i.e., is
discussable as pattern), and “contingency resolves itself into
necessity” (i.e., the wholeness of generativity recovers the wholeness
of unfolding).[fn:: For further reflections on Nietzsche and wholeness, see cite:bishop2020holistic.]

* Discussion
<<Discussion>>

Anthropogenic climate change is a situation of major global concern:
it has been examined separately by proponents of both CLA and DPL.  We
use this recent history to frame future work building on the survey
and case study developed above.

In an overview on =theconversation.com=, Cameron Tonkinwise and Abby
Mellick Lopes write:
#+begin_quote
A design pattern is first an observation: “People in that kind of designed situation tend to do this sort of thing”. It is then possible to design an intervention that redirects those tendencies. If that intervention succeeds, it can become a recommended pattern to help other designers: “If you encounter this kind of situation, try to make these kinds of interventions” cite:theconversation2021.
#+end_quote
They amplify the ‘ethical’ aspect of their thinking:
#+begin_quote
... the patterns we are talking about, context-specific interactions
between people and things, are more like habits. They are tendencies
that lead to repeated actions.
#+end_quote
The 41 patterns they have developed include examples like \textsc{The Night-Time Commons},[fn:: https://www.coolingthecommons.com/pattern%20deck/] 
which:
#+begin_quote
... might shift daytime activities into cooler night times.  Some
places already have these patterns: night markets and night-time use
of outdoor spaces.  If locally adapted versions of these patterns
encourage people to adopt new habits, other patterns will be needed.
These will include, for example, ways to remind those cooling off
outdoors in the evening that others might be trying to sleep with
their naturally ventilating windows open.  Such interlinked patterns
point to the way pattern thinking moves from the big scale to the
small.
#+end_quote
We were concerned that such interventions might not take account of
deep-seated views at the worldview layer, e.g., that certain kinds of
activities can only happen during the day.

Meanwhile, cite:HEINONEN2017101 discuss a CLA game that developed four
different scenarios in small groups.  The four scenarios were “Radical
Startups”, “Value-Driven Techemoths”, “Green DIY Engineers” and “New
Consciousness”.  As groups worked through the CLA for each scenario,
they developed a range of new ideas.  How would these have collated
with the patterns developed by Tonkinwise and Lopes and colleagues?
Might players have spotted ways in which the patterns would conflict
with deeper values — or ways in which they might be exploited to cause
chaos in the city cite:friction2016a?

Broadening our exploration of how design patterns relate to futures
studies, we should mention Schwartz cite:schwartz1996a (Appendix,
pp. 241-248), /viz./, his “Steps to Developing Scenarios”.  This process
follows an outline with a striking similarity to a design pattern
template.  Both Alexander and Schwartz advocate the identification of
driving forces in a context.  However, unlike Alexander, Schwartz does
not intend to resolve conflicts between the forces within a
harmonising design.  On the contrary, the aim in the scenario
development method is to understand how these forces might evolve and
lead to diverse scenarios.  As scenarios develop, they can serve as
the ground for developing new design work in Alexander’s sense.  In
the foregoing sections, we used a method from future studies to think
about design patterns.  We think that design patterns can be useful
inside scenarios and to scaffold the design and evolution of
scenarios.

Along these lines, here are four scenarios of interest, roughly pegged
to the four layers of CLA.  On that note, we should emphasise that
these scenarios are not mutually exclusive.

\medskip *I.* Patterns have periodically been discussed in explicitly
computational terms — however, that direction of work so far remains
mostly at the level of a proposal cite:alexander1999a,moran1971a, with
limited discipline-specific uptake within architectural design
cite:jacobus2009a,OXMAN1994141.  Could this change?  We wonder if
design patterns — and related designs for Ostrom-style institutions
cite:ostrom2009a (p. 11) — should be brought onto a similar
computational footing, and included in the computational mix within
climate modelling software.  These developments might be accompanied
by more mathematical precision along the lines of our [[FORMALISE][FORMALISE]] pattern.

\medskip
*II.* In the field of policy, ‘adaptive capacity’ describes a society’s
ability to recover after a shock
cite:thonicke2020advancing,magnan2010better.
This in turn is linked with the health and adaptivity of the society’s
institutions cite:fidelman2017institutions.  As we saw earlier,
innovation conflicts with consistency and efficacy — however,
innovation in fact may be a necessary response to other ongoing
environmental changes.  Mehaffy and coauthors worked with Ward
Cunningham to make their book /A New Pattern Language for Growing
Regions/ cite:mehaffy2020new into a wiki, [[http://npl.wiki][npl.wiki]], which is licensed
under CC BY-SA 4.0.  Will other pattern developers follow suit and
move to open licensing — and suitable infrastructures for working with
open contents?

# add refs to reproducible research papers
# add refs to Minnesota 2050 paper
# Maybe add a comment saying these people were ‘sort of’ working together (in different rooms)

\medskip *III.* As we’ve seen in our work with Emacs, PlanetMath,
Peeragogy — as with other free/libre/open source projects — projects
need a lot more than source code to thrive.  We see a link to
the topic of reproducible research.  Above and beyond the technical
considerations cite:sandve2013ten, we think that something is “reproducible” if it
is teachable to someone new!  We’ve found Org Mode (and literate
programming in general) to be useful for this.  At the same time,
collaboration across different skill sets is challenging.  Already in
the Minnesota 2050 project, participants were selected from a variety
of professions and leadership roles to produce scenarios for energy
and land use, and combined modelling with scenario planning
cite:olabisi2010.  However, actually solving large-scale problems together in
interdisciplinary teams will require new thinking and additional tools: to
bridge between the viewpoints of, e.g., professional futurists,
programmers, data scientists, local farmers — and to draw on the
insights of citizen scientists cite:wildschut2017a.

\medskip *IV.* Reflecting on the increasingly contextual and
transdisciplinary nature of the discussions at PLoP and other venues,
along with the other points above, brings to mind Hesse’s /The Glass
Bead Game/.  This reference can help tie these points together at the
level of myth, metaphor, and narrative:
#+begin_quote
... the narrator informs us that the Game is like a universal
language: a way of connecting traditions and cultures from both the
East and the West and of playing with all disciplines and
values. cite:roberts2007conscientisation
#+end_quote
For those who are familiar with the novel, this reference also
suggests: proceed with caution.  How hierarchical do we want our
community, or our society, to be?  How critical are we capable of
being towards the tenets we hold dear?  When reflecting on
futures-oriented discourses, Slaughter described these as sitting on a
spectrum: “participatory and open at one pole and closed (or
professionalised) at the other” cite:SLAUGHTER1989447.  In /The Glass
Bead Game/, everyone is able to play, but only some become excellent.
Related issues show up in our current technological culture
cite:unger2019knowledge — how do they show up in the cultures we might
envision?

# maybe reference the Bloom’s 2 Sigma problem here
# Only half of the students will make it to the end of the course and only half of those get A’s

\medskip Our vision for change is that all of these scenarios will be
given serious thought.  Progress will become measurable partly by
citations to this paper!  If the ideas we have considered became part
of a shared outlook, many more things will start to move more quickly.

* Conclusion
<<Conclusion>>
We conclude with a PAR for the paper as a whole.
\bigskip

\noindent
*1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?*
- Our intention was to apply the CLA method from future studies to the pattern theory, in order to provide a methodologically salient perspective on the future of the pattern theory — in brief, to answer the core question: “what is our vision for change and how is progress measurable?”
*2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?*
- We walked through the CLA’s layers, using the Poststructural Futures Toolbox to help surface connections and ideas that unpack the discourse around design pattern, drawing on empirical, interpretive and critical perspectives.
- We then zoomed in on a concrete case study that connected CLA with PARs and patterns.
- Lastly, we connected our observations with some broader literature on future studies to propose some directions for future work, specifically focusing on adaptation to climate change.
*3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?*
- JC: I did most of the hands-on-the-keyboard writing up to 11/06/2021, aided by frequent and detailed discussions with Ray, and an editorial perspective added by Charlie.  We went over the material in depth and there are lots of notes that didn’t make it into the paper!  I’m looking forward to discussing the content with ERG. We have used CLA to engage in a process of Friereian /conscientização/ cite:roberts2007conscientisation, drawing on [[SERENDIPITY][SERENDIPITY]], transdisciplinarity, and the process of “drinking our own champagne”.
-
-
*4. What did we learn or change?*
- Relative to an earlier preprint where we attempted to describe patterns to the futures community, this seems much more mature.  It is a fitting third installation to round out Joe’s “Patterns” trilogy cite:corneli2015a,Corneli2018.  In contrast to the vision of Alexander, this one is more humanistic in nature.
*5. What else should we change going forward?*
- We will have to see whether PLoP accepts any of our proposals; both as a submission for PLoP 2021, and, more speculatively, as a way of working.
- We believe we have an answer to Alexander’s question.  We’re not sure he’ll like it.  The ‘Chartres of programming’ has been hidden in plain view all along.  Jodorowsky refers to the Marseilles Tarot as a “nomadic cathedral” cite:jodorowsky2009way (p. 10); pattern languages are the same sort of thing.

* APPENDIX: Max-Neef needs                                          :noexport:
Because the notion of “need” is hard to fully pin down, as a working assumption we will follow Alexander and “replace the idea of need by the idea of what people are trying to do” cite:alexander1970a.  However, we will cross-check our work against an established catalogue of needs in an Appendix.

* Discussion draft 2 :noexport:
<<Discussion>>

[JC: This section is mostly first draft status and perhaps we should
quickly turn to the discussion of *climate change* rather than the sort
of ruminative stuff that’s here currently.  But, maybe the ruminations
can help scaffold that.]

We think that this tripartite workflow of /reflection/, /integration/, and
/operationalisation/ will be useful in many settings.  The three
components are are mutually supportive.  Without one or more of them,
we run the risk of missing something important.  Indeed, we could
describe a correspondence between these high-level methods and the
design pattern form itself:
#+BEGIN_LATEX
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{llcl}
\mathit{reflection}&(\mathrm{PAR}) &\approx& \mathit{context}\\
\mathit{integration}&(\mathrm{CLA}) &\approx& \mathit{problem}\\
\mathit{operationalisation}&(\mathrm{Patterns}) &\approx& \mathit{solution}\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
#+END_LATEX

How could these elaborated methods further enliven the pattern
discourse its full transdisciplinary extent?  One way to address that
question is to think about how the methods we’ve talked about relate
to other “pattern-like” discourses.

** Diversion on pattern-like discourses
[JC: It’s not that we necessarily need to have any pointers on
technical implementation stuff here, but I was otherwise just a bit
distracted about these things, and wondering where our technical work
fits in.  So, I started doing a little sketching here.]

There are many different kinds of templates that people use for design
purposes; Corneli et al. cite:Corneli2018 provide a partial survey.
Here are three that have a particularly computational flavour.

*** Zettlekasten

‘Zettlekasten’ means /slip-box/.  The ZK method (for short) has been
popularised recently through software packages like Roam Research, Org
Roam, Obsidian, Zettlr, and others.  The central common features of ZK
tools are that they provide a collection of named notes, which can be
linked using wiki-style links; the software maintains /backlinks/
between these nodes.  While the backlink features existed in Mediawiki
and other wikis, it has had a renaissance with ZK, which also includes
some methodological points about how to write.  Nodes inside ZK are
“pattern-like” in that they have an upstream and downstream context,
determined by backlinks and standard forward links respectively.

*** Contract-based programming

In contract-based programming, functions are given explicit pre- and
post- conditions.  Alongside checking whether an implementation
matches its specification, this means that potential users of a
function can reason about their contextual behaviour based on reading
the contracts, without having to actually run the code.
Contract-based programs are “pattern-like” in that their operating
environment or /upstream context/ is defined; the way they modify this
environment is also defined as a /downstream context/.

*** Tuple-stores

The basic flavour of a tuple-store is a /triple store/ in which each
element is a subject-verb-object triple.  Some tuple stores expand
this, e.g., with a time period in which the triple is considered to be
true, or with the notion of a graph which collects certain triples,
and so on.  Various notions of ‘context’ are embedded here: a given
point in time, for example, could be taken to represent a given state
of an evolving world in which a given fact is contextualised.  At any
given point in time, a subject can also be considered relative to
different contextually-related objects.  The notion of ‘problem’ and
‘solution’ is less obviously apparent, but one straightforward
way to understand these concepts here as queries and answers to queries.

** Futures work

[JC: Not sure if needed, just pencilling this in, in case we want to
recycle the most patterns-focused part of our /Futures/ submission.]

To broaden our exploration of how design patterns relate to futures
studies, we refer to Schwartz cite:schwartz1996a (Appendix,
pp. 241-248), viz., his “Steps to Developing Scenarios”.  This process
follows an outline with a striking similarity to a design pattern
template.  Both Alexander and Schwartz advocate the identification of
driving forces in a context.  However, unlike Alexander, Schwartz does
not intend to resolve conflicts between the forces within a
harmonising design.  On the contrary, the aim in the scenario development
method is to understand how these forces might evolve and lead to
diverse scenarios.  As scenarios develop, they can serve as the ground
for developing new design work in Alexander’s sense.

In the foregoing sections, we used a method from future studies to think about design patterns.  We also think that design patterns can be very useful for scaffolding thinking about the future.  To assist in describing the next steps building on this work, we can be aided by a few more patterns.

*** ROADMAP
<<ROADMAP>>
(This resummarises the \textsc{Roadmap} pattern cite:corneli2015a.)

- Context :: A group needs to coordinate its activities over a period of time.
- Problem :: The landscape is complex and not completely knowable *BUT* adjustment to action based on feedback is possible;
- Solution :: Use an explicit mechanism to share information about goals, obstacles, methods, and resources.

*** PARTICIPATORY SCENARIO PLANNING
<<PARTICIPATORY SCENARIO PLANNING>>
- Context :: You want to plan for possible future scenarios.
- Problem ::  You have an interested group *BUT* no “expert” has all the answers;
- *Solution* :: Pool the collected expertise of the affected communities.

*** PLAY TO ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE
<<PLAY TO ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE>>
- Context :: You want to have fun with friends, colleagues or acquaintances.
- Problem :: You want to explore possible futures *BUT* time travel does not exist and you don’t know what to expect
- Solution :: Play a game that lets you experience a plausible future scenario together.

** Future work

[JC: Pretty much rough draft status.]

Relative to the analysis and case study, here are high-level issues collected from across the layers we surveyed, which seem to need further attention.

- Litany :: It could be useful to develop a pattern language of
  critiques and flaws of the pattern method, elaborating the
  criticisms collected by Dawes and Ostwald, and showing how and where
  these criticisms can be usefully applied, or where they are out of
  scope.  One way to explore this material would be via the [[PLAY TO ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE][PLAY TO
  ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE]] pattern, adapting a game like “Flaws of the
  Smart City” cite:friction2016a to develop a playful approach to
  engage with “Flaws of the Design Pattern Methodology”.  To the
  extent that we can [[FORMALISE][FORMALISE]] the objects under discussion, some of
  these issues can be explored computationally.  So far, patterns have
  been /discussed/ in explicitly computational terms, though that
  direction of work seems to be mostly at the level of a proposal
  (Alexander, 1999; Moran, 1971), within limited discipline-specific
  uptake within architectural design (Jacobus, 2009; Oxman, 1994).
  Can this change?
- System :: Develop a pattern language of PLoP, more thoroughly
  reconstructing the thematic and historical development of the
  research to date and elaborating its next steps.  This is one place
  in which the [[ROADMAP][ROADMAP]] pattern would apply: in this case the project
  would begin by building our roadmap for the future relative to the
  existing landscape, drawing on the [[GENEALOGY][GENEALOGY]] pattern. It would be
  useful to have an improved a technical system for working with
  patterns: here the \textsc{Reduce, Reuse, Recycle} cite:corneli2015a
  pattern is particularly relevant, as is the [[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE][REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]]
  pattern.  The Emacs Research Group could potentially help design
  this system, along with downstream applications like a [[RECOMMENDER][RECOMMENDER]].
- Worldview :: Develop a pattern language of the philosophical
  commitments held by practitioners, using [[ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES][ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND
  FUTURES]] to bring out the fact that we are not necessarily living in
  “the same” world, according to our different worldviews, and to use
  this to enhance [[DIVERSITY][DIVERSITY]] of thought.  Some friction is likely to
  come up when we run into different kinds of tool use.  Perhaps the
  metaphor of /interoperability/ from Clojure could be helpful in
  sorting some of these things out.
- Myth :: Develop a catalogue of significant symbols used by
  practitioners.  Notice that apart from being an experience or
  mindset [[SERENDIPITY][SERENDIPITY]] is also a way of narrating and thinking about
  experience, and that these skills are teachable.  The increasingly
  contextual and transdisciplinary nature of the discussions at PLoP
  and other venues suggest that it may be time to redevelop pattern
  language methods more formally along the lines of /The Glass Bead
  Game/.  However, we should carefully examine whether this is a
  discourse only for experts and specialists, or whether it is a
  popular literacy. Slaughter described futures-oriented activities as
  a spectrum: “participatory and open at one pole and closed (or
  professionalised) at the other”
  cite:SLAUGHTER1989447. [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]] and other elements of the
  poststructural futures toolbox could be useful here.  At the level
  of classical myth we can notice a tension between Prometheus and
  Themis: the specialist artisan who snatches fire from the gods, and
  the titan Themis whose tool is the scales of justice.
