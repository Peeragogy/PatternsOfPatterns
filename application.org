* Introduction
<<Introduction>>

In 1999, Christopher Alexander discussed the future of design patterns
with an audience of programmers. Here, we revisit the questions he
asked using an established technique from the field of future
studies. The contribution in this paper is firstly, methodological,
and secondly, constructively-critical:
- We demonstrate how methods from future studies, design pattern
  theory, and distributed project management can be combined.
- Our analysis points to issues that the design pattern community will
  wish to consider as it shapes its own further development.

A reader who wishes to focus on methods should be able to read Section
[[methods]] in a stand-alone fashion, where we give practical guidance and
examples.  Section [[Figure]] provides a detailed case study in the
methods, and will be of interest to software practitioners.  Section
[[Ground]] is a more wide-ranging and reflective analysis of design
patterns literature and practices.  Sections [[Discussion]]-[[Conclusion]]
prepares the ground for further work building on the foregoing
material.

** Outline of Methods
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:

We detail three techniques which can help a community carry out
self-evaluation and peer learning.  Each of the methods has natural
use-cases when considered in isolation.  When combined, they provide a
more holistic mixed pattern.  We mean this in a precise sense, as
will be explained in due course.  Here’s how the methods work in brief:

*** Project Action Review is the sensory element: systematically gathering and verifying observational data.
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:

The Project Action Review is structured around five questions which
members of a community discuss and answer, typically during or shortly
after an event such as a meeting or working sesion.  It is also
possible to perform “pre-PARs” to envision the way a project might
develop.  This practice generates a record of the event, as seen
through the eyes of the participants, along with their evaluation of
what transpired.  In the moment, the PAR allows us to draw out views
which might have gone unstated otherwise.  Over time, projects which
use PARs improve their chances of staying grounded in reality as
circumstances evolve.  We can additionally use PARs to help check how
effectively we are using other methods.

*** Causal Layered Analysis is the cognitive element: giving organization and depth to the enterprise.
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:

Causal Layered Analysis combines techniques from poststructuralism,
macrohistory, and postcolonial multicultural theory.  The goal of this
methodology is to achieve a deep and inclusive understanding by
integrating empiricist, interpretative, critical, and actionable
knowledge surrounding a topic of concern.  Without CLA, or something
similar, there’s a risk of getting lost in the details, whether
practical or theoretical.  A CLA-based meta-review of actions logged in PARs can provide a
skeleton that puts together the fleshy PAR components, assembling what
would be disjecta membra into a coherent body of self-knowledge.  By
critically re-examining concerns which might stay implicit in
pattern language, CLA facilitates more effective design.  It achieves
this by avoiding or untangling muddles: for example, CLA could help us
understand why we had prized a technological solution to what, upon
consideration, turned out to be a fundamentally social issue; or
vice-versa.

*** Design Pattern Language is the motor element: orchestrating and scaffolding action
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:

Individual design patterns present solutions to recurring problems:
they do this in a way that can be combined with other patterns and
adapted to different situations.  A DPL is a common language which a
community can use to discuss matters of design; it serves as a
repository of shared knowledge.  Having carefully analyzed the
situation and identified a possible solution, we must plot a course of
action that accounts for the complexities of the situation.  The
flexibility of DPLs allows the structure to be customized to our
particular circumstances as they evolve.

** Summary of Findings
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:

In the Case Study section, we focus on the concrete use of the methods
described above in the context of planning and managing a
transdisciplinary research seminar that studies the Emacs editor.  We
show how we have used PARs, CLA, and DPLs, to develop a sense of
direction for our research in concert with related efforts.  This case
study provides a detailed practical example that other projects across
the pattern language pace may wish to emulate (or adapt) in their
settings.

In the Analysis, we use CLA to analyse design patterns methods.  DPLs
provide a general-purpose design methodology.  However, the high-level
evolution of this method in response to criticism, innovation,
technical developments, and long-term cultural change has not been
previously studied in an integrated manner.  CLA allows us to surface
the direction of travel of pattern language methods, by helping us
integrate foundational perspectives and empirical observation.  We
identify trends within the pattern discourse towards transdisciplinary
thinking and large-scale collaboration; and we connect Alexander's
concept of wholeness with the broader evolution of Western
philosophical thought.  This, in turn, shapes our understanding of
what pattern language can do.

** Outline of implications
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:

In our Discussion we draw out implications for the future of
design patterns.  We look briefly at how DPLs and CLA have been
applied (separately) to discuss the problem of anthropogenic climate
change.  We suggest that the integrated strategy we propose here could lead
to more satisfactory outcomes on problems of this scale.  We then
develop four scenarios for the possible future development of
pattern-theoretic methods.  In the section on Related Work, we engage
with further critical views, along with similar techniques that have
been applied in the various communities who developed the methods we
are studying.  By way of Conclusion, we present a PAR for the paper as a
whole.  This is offered as an example of a potential best-practice for
pattern authors, on the view that widespread adoption of this method
would help improve collaboration within the design patterns community.

** Project Action Review

The US Army developed a methodology called the /After Action Review/ or
AAR, which they use in training elite soldiers
cite:Training-the-Force.  AARs can be used to assign responsibility
when things ‘go wrong’ in these trainings, and can help people figure
out how to do better next time.  The method has been used effectively
in business settings cite:learning-in-the-thick-of-it.  In a
distributed peer-to-peer collaboration, we wanted an adaptation of the
AAR that would make it more open ended and horizontal in nature.  We
came up with the following template:

1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
4. What did we learn or change?
5. What else should we change going forward?

When we fill in the template, we call it “doing a /PAR”/.  As an
acronym, “PAR” has stood for various things over the years —
Peeragogical Action Review, Project Action Review — but we like PAR as
a stand-alone term.  Allusively, it brings to mind the corresponding
concept of /par/ in golf, and helps give us a sense of how we are doing
at any given point in time.[fn:: “In golf, par is the predetermined
number of strokes that a proficient golfer should require to complete
a hole, a round (the sum of the pars of the played holes), or a
tournament (the sum of the pars of each round).” — Wikipedia] Like the
Army, we typically use PARs retrospectively (so, asking, “what /did/ we
expect to learn or make together?”).  In this sense “doing a PAR”
shares common ground with the \textsc{Daily Scrum} and
\textsc{Sprint Retrospective} cite:sutherland2019a patterns from
Scrum.  However, PARs can be used without the product orientation of
Scrum.  Indeed, PARs can also be applied to look forward, proactively, as a
way to scaffold anticipation by “remembering the future”
cite:arnkil2008remembering.  In that case, item #5 can be expanded to
include a number of different forward-looking scenarios.  As an
example, Table \ref{exemplar-par} is the first PAR prepared by the Emacs Research Group, whose work we will look at in more detail in our Case Study.

\item \textbf{What else should we change going forward?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ongoing dialogue
\item Maybe with breakout groups
\item Need for governance for this; getting public, taking time we need going forward
\item Many actions need to be taken forward but we have too many right now: maybe this should be the next objective to pick a good viable project to go after now
\item Can set up a shared Org Roam + Firn instance: do we want to use this?
\item Can work have something similar w/in Org Roam
\item Someone to schedule the next meeting... accomodate UTC+8, maybe use BBB; Leo will publish scheduler

** Causal Layered Analysis
<<CLA_patterns>>

Sohail Inayatullah developed Causal Layered Analysis (CLA)
cite:inayatullah1998b,inayatullah2004causal as a research methodology
for examining a topic of concern at four levels that he refers to as
/litany/, /system/, /worldview/ and /myth/.  Here, we explain each of the
levels according to the following schema:

- *Contents*: /What is found at this level?/
- *Analysis*: /Techniques for analysis at this level./
- *Literature*: /Instances of texts which typically operate at this level./

In developing a Causal Layered Analysis, none of the four layers is
privileged over the others, nor are they examined in isolation.
Rather, one moves between them, examining how they relate to one
another.  Looking at an issue at different levels provides
complementary insights.  One can then integrate these insights to form
a more comprehensive basis for understanding what is happening in the
present and for anticipating the future.  To illustrate the four
layers and associated techniques, we introduce a running example of a
mom-and-pop pizza shop, together with mnemonic images in Figures
[[spring]]-[[winter]].

*** Litany

- *Contents*: Observable facts, events, and quantitative trends.
- *Analysis*: Minimal processing of data.
- *Literature*: News reports, tax filings, chit-chat.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .55\textwidth :placement [H]
#+CAPTION: 🍕 Example, Litany layer: Imagine a couple who on some of their first dates enjoy going out for pizza. They like different toppings, but that doesn’t particularly matter, because each of them orders their own perfectly sized Neopolitan-style pizza, and eats it with gusto. Indeed, it turns out they like pizza so much that they would like to have it several nights a week. Going out that frequently would be expensive, so they erect a brick oven in their backyard and get good at making their own pizzas at home: selecting good ingredients, fermenting the dough, and baking at a high temperature. After some time goes by, they have gotten really good at this, and they daydream about opening their own restaurant. They look into some available practical guidance and adapt it for their use case. After a lot of planning and a whole lot of work, they get their new pizza restaurant up and running, and they are doing good business. However, as more time goes by, they begin to notice some stress.

*** System

- *Contents*: The social, economic, political, and historical forces which shape events.
- *Analysis*: Technical explanations and interpretation of data within a given paradigm.
- *Literature*: Editorials and policy institute reports.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\textwidth :placement [H]
#+CAPTION: 🍕 Example, System layer: Mom has practical experience of how restaurants operate coming from summers she spent working in a diner.  Pop is handy with tools, so he can set up and maintain restaurant equipment.  The policies of the town are favorable to small businesses.  The demographics of the town include a number of busy families with children who form a reliable customer base for the pizzeria.  As the pace of economic recovery picks up, townspeople have more money and less time, so they frequent restaurants and order takeout more frequently.  The restaurant maintains good connections with local suppliers, and Mom and Pop are proud of the high quality and affordable dining experience they can offer.  The upshot of all of this is that business is booming: but in its own way this only contributes to their stress.  Arguments ensue about who should be managing the restaurant, on what days, where to get the ingredients, and how much they should spend.  They strongly desire to “sort it out”.  However, after a few discussions, they find it difficult to tease out the real reason for their disagreements and end up even more frustrated.

*** Worldview

- *Contents*: Core values and attitudes which motivate choices and
  actions.
- *Analysis*: Uncover deep assumptions and study the mental and
  linguistic constructs which undergird how people interact with each
  other and their surroundings.  Compare and critique paradigms and
  discourses.
- *Literature*: Works of philosophy and critical theory.

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 700px
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .8\textwidth :placement [H]
#+CAPTION: 🍕 Example, Worldview layer: Pop values self-reliance and self-cultivation. For him, the worth of a person is determined not by possessions, external circumstances, or social status, but by character and accomplishments. He believes that every person has an inner purpose and that the surest way to be happy and useful to society is to follow one's inner voice and encourage others to do the same. Mom values relationships and community. Her goal in life is to make the world a better place by bringing people together and slowing down the pace of life at least long enough to let neighbors chat and get to know each other.  Despite the difference in approach and outward orientation, both of them have worldviews which are fundamentally oriented towards people: most of the time they get along well, and they enjoy working together.  It takes them some time and a few late-night discussions with friends to start to come to grips with their current challenges.  Pop, inspired by historical figures like Thoreau, sees living “off-grid” as an ideal: a way to be independent from modern civilization, and more in touch with nature.  It can be hard for him to reconcile his community spirit with his individualism.  Mom, on the other hand, envisions an ideal community where healthy relationships are facilitated over good meals.  She sees the restaurant as a way to build relationships with diners and others in the food supply chain and local community.  These two worldviews — while not disjoint or necessarily in conflict — are not automatically well aligned, either.  If the couple wishes to resolve the stress that they are facing, they would be wise to wonder if their problems originate at an even deeper level: one which they may never have explored with one another before.
[[./mushrooms.jpg]]

\clearpage
*** Myth

- *Contents*: The symbols and tales which give meaning to life.
- *Analysis*: Study archetypal symbols and the myths and rituals within which they participate.
- *Literature*: Poetry, art, anthropology, Jungian analysis.

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 700px
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .6\textwidth :placement [H]
#+CAPTION: 🍕 Example, Myth layer: Pop looks up to Thoreau and Emerson as personal heroes, and knows /Walden/ and /Self-Reliance/ backwards and forwards.  Mom looks back to childhood memories of parents who loved cooking together and her memories evoke an age of innocence.  For her, the circle is a powerful symbol of wholeness and community: when she brings a pizza to children at the round tables of the restaurant, she feels like a mystagogue initiating the next generation.  They go to speak with a wise counsellor, who they meet in a consulting room filled with lovely plants.  Together, they put together a strategy that helps them to respond to the circumstances that have evolved.  They decide to close the shop Monday through Wednesday, to spend time away from the business.  They engage with hobbies like writing, woodwork, and painting, and they tend their garden together.  They develop new ideas, both related to food and otherwise.  Thursday through Sunday, they resolidify their intention to make their work together a meditation on love.  Boosted by their time off, they prepare more innovative meals and, while the restaurant remains affordable, they garner enthusiastic crit from foodies.

** Design Patterns
Let’s begin by setting to one side any specialist notion of ‘patterns’
that we may have in mind, and think about patterns in a fundamental
way.  Some patterns repeat in /space/, some in /time/, some in both /space
and time/ — a tiling, a beat, a wave.  In the physical world, it would
seem that patterns cannot repeat exactly, or forever.  The elements
that comprise a pattern are subject to spatial or temporal
displacement, and other forms of variation.

Let’s now explore the notion of ‘design pattern’ starting from this
foundation.  Leitner supplied the following summary: "[Design]
Patterns are shared as complete methodic descriptions intended for
practical use by experts and non-experts" \citep{leitner2015a}.  As we
look into the matter further, two central features emerge.  Like an
ellipse, the concept of the design pattern has two main foci: context
and community.
# [fn:: An ellipse is the set of all points in a plane such that the sum of their distances from two fixed points is a constant.]

- /Context/ shapes and constrains the type of activity which is being considered, such as designing a building, or writing software.
- /Community/ encompasses the stakeholders --- experts and non-experts alike --- who are involved with or affected by a particular project.

Integral to the basic concept of a design pattern is a third feature
that describes the interaction of the community and the context.  The
community uses the pattern to overcome some real or potential /conflict/
that they experience within this context.  The conflict is also
referred to as a /problem/; its resolution is described as a /solution/.
Alexander and Poyner emphasised that ‘design’ is not needed when the
conflict can be resolved in an obvious or straightforward manner.  For
example, you typically would not need a design process surrounding
/sitting in a chair/, because “under normal conditions each one of the
tendencies which arises in this situation can take care of itself”
\citep[p.~311]{alexander1970a}.

All of this means that design patterns need to achieve something
fairly subtle.  Each represents the synthesis of a repeatable solution
to a type of conflict which itself repeats within a particular
context.  Furthermore, it does this in a way that makes the solution
teachable, learnable, and otherwise replicable within a given
community.  However, if the design pattern makes the solution to the
problem too obvious, then “design”, /per se/, is no longer needed![fn::
For example, Peter Norvig argued that we see fewer of the design
patterns typical of Object Oriented programs inside programs written
in functional and dynamic languages, because these languages embed
many of the typical OO patterns as language features.]  We
might say that the design pattern carries with it a fragment of
irreducible complexity.  This perspective may or may not be
surprising.

Alexander had described the need for patterns when things get complex
cite:alexander1964notes.  He specifically focuses on what could be
called “horizontal” complexity, a situation where there are a lot of
moving parts and relations between them.  Methodologically this is
elaborated with the notion of a /pattern language/.[fn:: The issues involved become somewhat more complex when there are multiple DPLs interoperating, but are not fundamentally different.]
Pattern languages have a property of unfolding, from more general to
more specific.  However, they do not necessarily cover deeper forms of
“vertical” complexity, where there are deep historical or ontogenetic
causes, feedback loops, or complex conceptual issues which are not readily
expressible in design-pattern-theoretic terms.  Let’s have another
look at these issues by way of two contrasting metaphors.

The first metaphor comes from Christian Kohls, who proposed to treat
each design pattern as a journey: “a path as a solution to reach a
goal” cite:kohls2010a.  In this metaphor, design patterns are
understood to have an initial condition and an end condition, defined
within some context. The context also associates a cost to traversals
of paths.  There are several associated problems: the elementary
problem is to traverse the terrain and travel from the start state to
the end state.  The next problem is to do this at low cost.  The third
problem is to find a reliably repeatable way to do this.  A fourth problem is to describe the process in such a way that the path
can be traversed by others.

The second metaphor comes from Joseph Campbell, who described an
“archetypal pattern” cite:shalloway2005a, one that can be found
embedded in myths and stories across diverse cultures and historical
periods.  The “hero’s journey” is also described with a path
cite:campbell1949a, however, in this case the path runs in a circle,
and the journey focuses on the transformations of the hero who
traverses it.  Although an account of the journey can be shared,
traversal is effectively single-use.  The cost is typically “high.”
Nevertheless, once a myth or metaphor is established in a shared
narrative, the journey can be reenacted through ritual or engaged with
in other ways that solve a range of social problems
cite:handelman1998a. In short, the difference between these two elementary traversal stories suggests that the process of finding “the path that is capable of leading to a good structure” cite:alexander1999a may contain irreducible complexity — even when sharing the information about the path is relatively simple.

** Summary
Having described the DPL, CLA, and PAR methods we are in a position to
explain how they combine into one holistic pattern, in Leitner’s sense
of a complete methodic description.  We will write this down using the
classical DPL format: describing the associated /context/, the /problem/
denoting a conflict, together with a /solution/.  As it happens, the
three acronyms can be combined and remixed in a clever way to provide
a title for this pattern.  This accurately suggests that the methods
need not be run in a fixed order, but are interwoven together.

*** PLACARD
<<PLACARD>>
- *Context*: In the course of working on a project together: /we use the PAR to understand and establish our working context/.
- *Problem*: Although we may encounter many difficulties in this context, our effort to understand them faces a central *challenge*, namely the fact that the problems span different layers and scales of complexity, so it can be hard to understand where the difficulties actually come from: accordingly, /we use the CLA to understand and frame the problems and their interconnections/.
- *Solution*: Once we have grasped the problem, we need to elaborate an actionable solution that remains adaptable to ongoing changes in the context: /we use DPL to elaborate the solution/.

* Case study: Planning “Season 1” for the Emacs Research Group
<<Figure>>

This section summarises the concrete application of the methods
from Section [[methods]] within an active seminar, the Emacs
Research Group, which was convened following EmacsConf
2020.[fn:: https://emacsconf.org/2020/; the conference took place November 28th and 29th of 2020.]
We illustrate how the
three methods introduced above interoperate.  In our case, this
analysis has allowed us to develop a trajectory for the project.
As a case study, this section gives more-or-less
self-contained example and shows how mixing the three methods
gives us more than the sum of the parts

In the ERG, we think of the work carried out up to this point as
*Season 0*, on the view that so far our thinking has developed
rhizomatically, underground, rather than fully in the public sphere.
The following analysis serves to contextualize our work relative to
the PLoP and Peeragogy communities.  Over the 25 sessions of our
seminar to date, we used CLA in combination with PARs to address the
question ‘What is our vision for change and how is progress
measurable?’.  More specifically: we did a PAR at the end of every
(approximately weekly, two-hour) session.[fn:: Data archived at
https://github.com/exp2exp/exp2exp.github.io, with meeting notes and
PARs indexed and viewable on the web at
https://exp2exp.github.io/erg.]  This allowed us to track progress,
and to surface key issues and concerns (e.g., bootstrapping needs
related to scheduling and collaboration tools, along persistent
questions about how best to go public, are documented in our first
PAR, reproduced in Table \ref{exemplar-par}).  Then, every six weeks
or so, we merged selected bullet-points from these PARs into the CLA
outline, depending on which section they seemed to fit best.  We
elaborated those bullet points into a narrative form, which we revised
to accommodate new data as time went on. We also began to develop TODO
items that would make the /next steps/ for this seminar group both
actionable and meaningful.[fn:: The Peeragogy approach to patterns is
aligned with the feminist principle is that /all knowledge is
incomplete/
(https://mitpress.podbean.com/e/experiments-in-open-peer-review/,
minute 5).  A “living” pattern is, accordingly, attached to Next Steps
that would help to realise that pattern within a context; when we
don’t have any next steps, we put the pattern in a
\textsc{Scrapbook}.]  Here, we collate these next steps with peeragogy
design patterns like \textsc{Roadmap}
cite:peeragogy-handbook-long.[fn:: See http://peeragogy.org/top for a
reworking of the /Peeragogy Handbook/ as a unified pattern language,
which extends the earlier presentation in cite:patterns-of-peeragogy.]
To make the case study more clear, we include the supporting data from
our first PAR.  By the time of our fourth iteration of the
$\mathrm{PAR}\rightarrow\mathrm{CLA}$ cycle, each section had

** Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change)

We’ve made progress since we started with the raw themes of *Research
on/in/with Emacs* back in December 2020.  We’ve met almost every week
since then, and interviewed some interesting and varied guests.  We
have a clearer idea of what we want to talk about at the next
EmacsConf, and how we can be of service to researchers and Emacs
users.  We have been using a workflow that helps us carefully review
progress, diagnose issues, and manage our energy.  The next phase of
this project is to “go public” and mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere, including by getting some training events up and
running.
# [fn:: Our plans for *Season 1* should allow flexibility for [[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE][REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]], since we may all be thinking about things differently, and we will have different outside commitments. This will allow us to develop a [[GENEALOGY][GENEALOGY]] of the themes and actions we are developing. This helps to realise the [[DISTANCE][DISTANCE]] pattern, since we can understand our efforts through the eyes of others. This helps to realise the [[ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES][ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES]] pattern, because we better understand how the project looks for someone who is just getting started now. A suitable degree of formality can assist with [[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE][REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]], see further details in the [[FORMAL PATTERNS][FORMAL PATTERNS]] pattern.]

** Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)

If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration.  We like to create tangible deliverables (e.g. journal
articles). However, “If we knew what the outcome was, it wouldn’t be
research” — therefore, we’re focusing initially on research methods
and design documents. That may result in a longer time to write
initial papers, but when something is released it is more thoroughly
prepared. Meanwhile, we keep our skills sharp by fixing bugs,
improving our own workflows, and actively exploring the landscape. All
these activities are part of the system we implement regularly, which
minimizes technical debt and allows space for serendipity to occur.

** Worldview, ways of knowing and alternative discourse

We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can learn from and eventually improve upon.
‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as,
respectively, ‘more bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualising
things.  Concretely, we’ve been studying our own processes and looking
for the tools and settings that are the most conducive to the work we
want to do.  For example, instead of having a single Org Roam
directory shared via Git, what if we had ways of managing sharing of
notes across ‘graphs’?

Collaboration is familiar to teams across all domains. Even authors
working alone will collaborate with their past and future selves. What
is common for all collaborators is that the transfer of information
must be uninhibited.  If we all had our slipboxes online, we could
interlink them.  This would generalise *ORCiD*, and people to
reference processes that are undergoing evolution.  Maybe a service
like this would turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’ — helping to match
people based on their interests (or similar people in different
fields).  So, what’s the price point?  Instead of paying money to go
to conferences, now we can spontaneously make conferences and
workshops.  As a guess, $750.0 per user per year might be a fair price
— for those who can afford to pay it — if the service helps people to
do better research and saves a bunch of travel.  We could also set up
a pricing model proportional to each country’s carbon emissions or
something like that.
# [fn:: Whereas these are existing commercial packages, some of the workflows could be restructured and, e.g., made more accessible or potentially more powerful through integration with other open tools. This is a way of [[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE][REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]] at the level of projects and business operations. We recognise that we’re all coming from different places with [[ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES][ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES]].  How can our workflow better reflect that? Can we engage in an ongoing [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]] of the methods as we use them? (Admittedly, a little bit like rebuilding the plane while it is still flying, but with some care it should be possible.) We can think about different ways of approaching knowledge construction as a way of deepening the [[GENEALOGY][GENEALOGY]] pattern in practice. By developing a paper that situates our work in a wider context we develop some [[DISTANCE][DISTANCE]] from the closed-doors of *Season 0* and engage more creative thinking (and others’ views on!) *Season 1*. Clearly, this is a way to operationalise [[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE][REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]]; see further details in the [[RECOMMENDER][RECOMMENDER]] pattern.]

** Myths, metaphors and narratives: imagined (longer term change)

In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘[[https://longtermist.substack.com/][long-term
perspective]]’.  This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking.  For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many cases the relevance of a given
innovation goes down over time.  However, Emacs has an evolutionary
character that has allowed it to keep up with the times — becoming
more relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to
systematise [[https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html][Editor MACroS]] for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO)
program.  Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the social
setting in which this work is done.  Whereas the concepts underlying
the free software movement were based on “[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html][communal sharing]]” of source
code, these methods can be extended and allow us to synthesise new
relationships within broader semiotic commons.  Emacs can become part
of a system for addressing large-scale existential problems, by
expanding the frontier of what’s possible for human beings.
# [fn:: As we develop the relationships of Emacs to its context, the process can operationalise [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]]. We referenced \textsc{Assessment} above with regard to PARs and CLAs; here we can imagine other techniques for assessing learning, thinking across [[ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES][ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES]] in which these methods become more embedded in technological workflows. One way to proceed could be through a [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]] of the practices of free/libre/open source; see further details in the [[DIVERSITY][DIVERSITY]] pattern.]

** Summary
The narrative paragraphs at each level describe patterns occurring
among, and mutual accommodation between, the bullet points that appear
in our PARs.  The Next Steps typically do not represent concrete
objectives, but are properly descriptions of anticipated patterns of
behaviour.  To refine these items into tasks that are concretely
doable within the upcoming Season 1 will require further breakdown and
elaboration.  We foresee this to be an iterative process, with
pointers /from/ draft next steps /to/ patterns emerging from the process
described above, while pointers /from/ patterns /to/ next steps should
ideally describe and enable concretely doable task breakdowns.

* Analysis: CLA applied to Design Pattern Language literature and practices
<<Ground>>


In the previous section we narrowed our attention to the Emacs
Research Group and developed a Causal Layered Analysis built by studying
the PARs we had carried out.  We connected the results with Peeragogy
patterns as a way to check our work and connect with a broader
community.  In this section, we will broaden our gaze considerably further.
Although the two sections traverse different scales, a CLA of the
design pattern community can be compared with what we saw above, and
this cross-scale comparison yields new perspectives.  This, in
turn, suggests opportunities for mutual learning and dialogue which
can lead to more comprehensive understanding.

Before embarking on the CLA itself, we present an example on the theme of
"openness", to show what might be expected to result from such an
analysis.  ERG and PLoP are both projects within the larger
system of contemporary computing, which is organised with various
loose hierarchical structures.  As such, both projects inherit
attributes from larger communities/networks and histories to which
they are heirs.  For example, ERG is a small subcommunity of the
larger Emacs community, and thus inherits two core tenets at the
woldview level:
- A preference for Free/Libre/Open-Source Software, as defined by the "four freedoms".
- Enthusiasm for the features and affordances of Emacs, an extensible, customizable, and self-documenting editor.

Both of these points have their origins in the worldviews and myths of
the hacker culture, in which Stallman, Steele and Gabriel all
participated.  At the social level, FLOSS is sometimes linked
rhetorically with the concepts like a "gift economy" and theories of
"self-organized emergence".

Whereas Stallman, Steele, and Gabriel come primarily from the
functional programming background, Ward Cunningham comes from the
Object Oriented programming subcommunity.  One initiative associated
with the latter is the =c2= pattern wiki.  There, too,
"openness" is a key value at the worldview level: however, upon closer
examination, we find differences of emphasis and interpretation.  With
Emacs, the emphasis is on availability of source code and the right to
reuse it.  For Cunningham, with =c2=, the emphasis was on in situ
editability and community effort:
#+begin_quote
The original wiki technology functioned in a direct open-source mode,
which allowed individuals to contribute small pieces to incrementally
improve the whole.
#+end_quote

A third perspective on openness comes from Gene Demby and Ashe Dryden,[fn:: https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/05/248791579/why-isnt-open-source-a-gateway-for-coders-of-color][fn:: https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community]
who, along with others, have pointed out that the open source
community may not be so open, in practical terms, to newcomers from
all genders and ethnic backgrounds.  Bringing these perspectives
together affords a more comprehensive understanding of the concept of
openness, along with its relationship to other linked concepts like
freedom, rights, and ethics; from this basis we can explore dialectic
tensions, and potentially initiate dialogue.

“Openness” is but one of the themes which will be developed through
the CLA of the DPL literature and practices.  In précis,

- We will examine queries having to do pattern language methods raised by Alexander and his collaborator Bryant, along with practical problems surfaced by Dawes and Ostwald.
- We examine issues related to how people share and discuss patterns, as well as the changing way in which these discussions have been framed at PLoP.
- We examine a worldview associated with patterns, through the lens of mob software and its critiques.
- Lastly, we looked at some of the symbols and philosophical thinking that enrich our understanding of the context in which Alexander developed his methods.

In this section, we omit PARs, and have not specifically developed the
material into high-level TODO items with connections to other
patterns, as done in the previous section.  Practical next steps could
be revisited in later work, and we discuss some likely directions in
the following sections.

** Litany: Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change)

The first layer in CLA is the *litany layer*: it describes the problems
that people are well familiar with.  In the case of the design
patterns discourse, this level includes, for example, the familiar
kinds of conflict-based problems that described in patterns and discussed
at PLoP, along with higher-order problems of application, and debates about these (e.g.,
ranging from Christopher Alexander’s “\textsc{Entryway Transition}” pattern to
his remarks about how people who attempted to apply his methods
ended up placing “alcoves everywhere”, etc.). This layer is sometimes
also referred to as the *problem level*: in the patterns discourse,
problems abound.  Indeed, one of the core attributes of the pattern community is that it
is not only comfortable with problems but that it actively seeks them
out with a ‘problematizing’ discourse.

Nevertheless, not all of the well-known and discussed problems have been solved.
For example, ‘Alexander's
Problem’, as described by his collaborator Greg Bryant, is that:
#+begin_quote
... despite all of the tools he created, his penetrating research, his
many well-wrought projects, and his excellent writing, he did not
manage to grant, to his readers, the core sensibility that drove the
work. He also did not organize the continuance of the research program
that revolves around this sensibility. cite:bryant2015
#+end_quote
Attempts to work out a solution are developing.[fn:: https://www.buildingbeauty.org/ and https://www.buildingbeauty.org/beautiful-software]
Coming at similar issues from a different direction, Alexander framed
this query for the programmers who were using pattern methods at the turn of the millennium:
#+begin_quote
What is the Chartres of programming? What task is at a high enough
level to inspire people writing programs, to reach for the stars?
cite:alexander1999a
#+end_quote
These are some of the high-level problems that are known and discussed
in the patterns community, but which do not necessarily have consensus
answers.  More recently, Dawes and Ostwald cite:dawes2017a develop an
elegant taxonomy of existing criticisms of the pattern method.  In
outline, their taxonomy covers criticisms at the following three
layers:
- Conceptualisation :: Ontology, Epistemology \newline /(e.g., “Rejecting pluralistic values confuses subjective and objective phenomena”)/
- Development and documentation :: Reasoning, Testing, Scholarship \newline\hfill /(e.g., “The definitions of ‘patterns’ and ‘forces’ are inexplicit”)/
- Implementation and outcomes :: Controlling, Flawed, Unsuccessful \newline\hfill /(e.g., “Patterns disallow radical solutions”)/

By showing how the criticisms relate to one another, Dawes and Ostwald
begin to develop a [[GENEALOGY][GENEALOGY]] at the level of critical perspectives.
At the very least the critiques they examine show that there is not just
one pattern discourse, but many.  In a parallel work the same authors analyse
the structure of /A Pattern Language/, and develop three alternative perspectives on
/APL/'s contents, which they refer to as the *generalised*, *creator*, and
*user* perspectives cite:Dawes2018.  These perspectives amount to different techniques
for [[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE][REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]].  We will elaborate at the next level.

** System: Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)
The *system* layer is typically understood in terms of the *social
phenomena* that cause the problems at the litany layer to emerge (along
with their familiar solutions).  In the original setting in which
patterns developed, this layer would have included causes such as more
people living in cities, combined with the possibility of developing a
more community-driven approach to design using contemporary
technologies.  In short, at this level, we examine where the familiar problems come from.

Using graph-theoretic measures of the /APL/ dataset, Dawes and Ostwald
cite:Dawes2018 found that:
- The creator model appears to be /less intelligible/ than the user model, while
- The creator’s perspective of the language is /more beautiful/.
Their central finding, however, is that many patterns in which
Alexander had medium or low confidence in fact occupy a relatively
central position in /APL/'s graph:

#+begin_quote
... the patterns which are most likely to be encountered by designers –
are most easily accessed, or provide greatest access to other patterns
– might be those which Alexander acknowledged were incapable of
providing fundamental solutions to the problems they addressed.
#+end_quote

This means that novice users could be expected to encounter problems
in application of /APL/'s patterns: “despite its often authoritative and
dogmatic tone, Alexander’s text was framed as a work in progress,
rather than a definitive design guide” (p. 22).  Dawes and Ostwald
suggest that their analysis could point to “prime opportunities to
continue the development of /A Pattern Language/'' (p. 21).

Here, however, a range of issues more closely linked to software and
media begin to crop up.  There are a range of ‘other’ pattern
discourses which could be relevant here — ‘other’ in the sense
mentioned in our [[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE][REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]] pattern, so not necessarily in
close touch with PLoP — these include PurPLSoc and the world of
practicing architects.  There have been some attempts at creating
systematic archives of patterns, but these haven’t always had significant
buy-in from a wide community.

Importantly, the first-ever Wiki was developed in connection with a
platform for developing, sharing, and revising pattern languages
cite:cunningham2013a.[fn:: http://wiki.c2.com/?PeopleProjectsAndPatterns][fn:: http://c2.com/ppr/]
However, there was a distinction between the discussions and the finished patterns.  In the 2013 retrospective,
Ward Cunningham writes:
#+begin_quote
The original wiki technology functioned in a direct open-source mode,
which allowed individuals to contribute small pieces to incrementally
improve the whole.
#+end_quote
This is true if by “open source” we understand /what you see when you click Edit/ — but
the statement could be misleading relative to contemporary usage, which is often linked with
the Open Source Initiative’s definition, which centers on the premise that
“Open source doesn’t just mean access to the source code.”[fn:: https://opensource.org/osd]
On the c2 wiki, licensing was restrictive. Discussions were to take place in “letters and replies” rather than revision or annotation of the published patterns; rights associated with the finished patterns were closely guarded.[fn:: http://c2.com/ppr/titles.html][fn:: http://c2.com/ppr/about/copyright.html]

Although Wiki technology could in principle have been a site for
ongoing [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]] of patterns, this didn’t seem to happen on c2.
This is itself interesting and worth deconstructing a bit.  Notably, there were only /four/ published “letters and
replies”.[fn:: http://c2.com/ppr/letters/index.html]  Unfortunately,
we could not find a public archive of the “design patterns mailing
list” where further discussions took place.  This is certainly
suggestive of contingency.

Over the years, other issues and concerns came to the fore.
Jenifer Tidwell’s charges against the Gang of Four (alongside other
developer-centric pattern languages) resonate with what we saw in
Dawes and Ostwald, above:

#+begin_quote
... the reality of a software artifact that the developer sees is not
the only one that's important.  What about the user's reality?  Why
has that been ignored in all the software patterns work that's been
done?  Isn't the user's experience the ultimate reason for designing a
building or a piece of software?  If that's not taken into account,
how can we say our building -- or our software -- is “good”? — http://www.mit.edu/~jtidwell/gof_are_guilty.html
#+end_quote

Notice that now the /user/ of the designed artefact has entered the
story as a different figure from the user of the pattern language,
whom we met above.  Tidwell’s critique suggests at least a
couple [[ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND
 FUTURES][ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES]]: e.g., what if the end-user had been
placed at the centre the whole time?  Alternatively, what if the
primary focus of patterns was to facilitate interaction between
different stakeholders?  The fact that Tidwell’s book
cite:tidwell2010designing and an essay by Jans Borchers cite:borchers2008pattern
which drew inspiration from her critique both have over
1000 citations on Google Scholar shows that Tidwell’s perspective has
been impactful.  To get a sense of how the pattern community may have
been informed by this critique — along with related trends and concerns — we can look at
how the Writers Workshops at PLoP have evolved over time.  In Table [[tabplop]], a
selection of titles of workshop sessions show how the focus of PLoP evolved from
primarily ‘programming’ oriented to a much broader contextual view
over time.  Indeed, by 2019, the focus is almost exclusively ‘contextual’.
The way the themes under discussion have evolved evokes the layers of CLA.

\rowcolors{2}{gray!25}{white}
** Worldview: ways of knowing and alternative discourse

The next layer comprises *worldviews* (e.g., Alexander’s view that
“There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and
spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness”).

The situation with licensing on c2 is particularly interesting in
light of Alexander’s perspective that /APL/ was a “living language”.  In
principle, Wiki technology might have presented the opportunity to
realise this vision fully for the first time, in a virtual setting.
Wiki technology did become widely influential when it was combined
with a free content license on Wikipedia (originally GNU FDL, later
CC-By-SA).

Fast-forwarding to the present day, Christopher Alexander’s website
=patternlanguage.com= writes about [[https://www.patternlanguage.com/membership/memberstour3-struggle.html][The Struggle for People to be Free]] —
but it is not referencing freedom in the GNU sense.

In 1979 he was concerned: “Instead of being widely shared, the pattern
languages which determine how a town gets made becomes specialized and
private.”  In 2021, /APL/ itself is only legally available for
subscribers or for people who purchase a paper copy of the book. (Or
through a library!)  Of course, like many famous texts it can also be obtained
extra-legally for download as a PDF: but that format does not afford
downstream users the opportunity to collaborate on the text’s further
development.

Gabriel and Goldman talk about sharing and ‘gift culture’ in their
essay [[https://dreamsongs.com/MobSoftware.html][Mob Software: The Erotic Life of Code]], and discuss a way of
working that seems to bring back the early days of hacker culture.
(Notably, this essay was presented as a keynote talk at the same
programming conference where Alexander had spoken four years
previously.)  They reference the open source community — but not the
free software community, so we will follow Gabriel and Goldman’s usage
here — as the origin of Mob Software.

#+begin_quote
Because the open source proposition asked the crucial first question,
I include it in what I am calling “mob software,” but mob software
goes way beyond what open source is up to today.
#+end_quote

That “crucial first question” is: “What if what once was scarce is now abundant?”
It is well known that the PLoP conference series builds on this idea: it includes
shepherding and workshops cite:gabriel2002a as well as games, informal gifts, and
other measures that aim to create a sense of psychological safety: all features
that make PLoP a space where ‘failure’ is OK and even celebrated, as per Mob
Software.  The essay develops its own criticisms of open source, e.g.,
“the open-source community is extremely conservative” and forking
happens rarely.  (Five years later, with the creation of Git, forking
became considerably more typical.)  Resonating with Tidwell’s critique
from above:

#+begin_quote
One difference between open source and mob software is that open
source topoi are technological while mob software topoi are people
centered.
#+end_quote

On a technical basis, Gabriel’s vision sounds a lot like today’s world
of /microservices/.
While his vision hasn’t fully come to pass — there are still many
services with proprietary source code — nowadays many big companies
are also big proponents of open source.  Here we can notice that
Gabriel was employing a technique of imagining [[ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES][ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND
FUTURES]], e.g., he imagined a future in which:

#+begin_quote
Mentoring circles and other forms of workshop are the mainstay of
software development education. There are hundreds of millions of
programmers.
#+end_quote

We would like to dig somewhat deeper into the foundations of the
worldview that Gabriel puts forth in this essay. Usefully, an article
by VanDrunen “traces the source of Gabriel’s ideas by examining the
authorities he cites and how he uses them and evaluates their validity
on their own terms” cite:vandrunenchristian.  His critique functions
as a (detailed) [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]] of the thinking behind Gabriel’s essay.
Some key excerpts appear in Table [[tabone]].

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “Kauffman’s work is about a rediscovery of the sacred, and it amounts to a proposal of the laws of self-organization as a new deity”                                                                                                                  |
| “One thing we find in common with Lewis Thomas’s ants, Kauffman’s autocatalytic sets of proteins, and the agents inhabiting Sugarscape is that they all lack intelligence.”                                                                           |
| “In other words, the rules given by Gabriel describe only the conforming aspect of group behavior. In reality, there is a tension between independent and conforming tendencies, and the flock patterns emerge from the interaction between the two.” |
| “His examples of ‘mob activity’... the making of the Oxford English Dictionary, cathedral-building, and open source software discussed later—all had oversight, master-planning of some sort.”                                                        |
| “There are several distinct senses of ‘gift’ that lie behind these ideas, but common to each of them is the notation that a gift is a thing we do not get by our own efforts.” (quoting Hyde)                                                         |
| “Certainly proprietary code is shared property among those working in a corporate development team, but it is not common to the larger community of software developers and users.”                                                                   |
| “A computer program is not like a poem or a dance in this way; if the programmer is not able to produce something parsable in the programming language or cannot fit the instructions together in a logical way, the program simply will not work.”   |
| “Gabriel’s own experience may color his perception. He founded a software company that produced programs for Lisp development and which went bankrupt after 10 years.”                                                                                |
| “Moreover, if Gabriel means to suggest that these programming languages or models could have made programming more accessible to the masses lacking technical skill, it is quite a dubious claim”                                                    |

** Myths: metaphors and narratives (longer term change)

Lastly, there are *myths or metaphors* (e.g., Alexander’s idea that the
architect’s work is done ‘for the glory of God’ (see Galle
cite:GALLE2020345) or his conception that ‘primitive’ dwellings
contain more life).  To emphasize, CLA does not dismiss myths in the
slightest: on the contrary, they are what drive the other layers.
Another term that is used to characterise this layer is *narratives*.

VanDrunen surfaced various concepts in Gabriel’s essay that would be
at home at this level, for example, the concept of duende that Gabriel
takes over from Garcia Lorca originally derives from /dueño de casa/,
the name of a certain kind of household spirit.  VanDrunen’s critique
is also useful for our purposes because it points to the importance of
considering the deeper layers in developing a concept.  It’s not just
a matter of finding a culture’s myths: there may also be a conflict at
this level.

One important narrative for the pattern discourse is in plain view
within the terminology of problems and solutions, which come from
mathematics or physics.  Alexander worked /at the level of narrative/
to connect the patterns discourse to a scientific worldview, seeking a
sense of objectivity.  For example, in “The Atoms of Environmental
Structure”:

#+begin_quote
most designers ... say that the environment cannot be right or wrong
in any objective sense but that it can only be judged according to
criteria, or goals, or policies, or values, which have themselves been
arbitrarily chosen.  We believe this point of view is mistaken.
#+end_quote

Notice that, here, the discourse is positioned as different from the
mainstream of architecture.  The key differentiator is not the
language of problems and solutions which would be familiar to anyone
with an engineering background; rather, but in a certain notion of
/wholeness/.  Which notion of wholeness remains to be surfaced.
Quoting, again, from “The Atoms of Environmental Structure”:

#+begin_quote
We believe that all values can be replaced by one basic value:
everything desirable in life can be described in terms of freedom of
people’s underlying tendencies. ... The environment should give free
rein to all tendencies; conflicts between people’s tendencies must be
eliminated.
#+end_quote

Historically, there are at least two major varieties of wholeness: one that
is based on progressive differentiation (perhaps understood as
unfolding from substance, per Spinoza), and the other generated by
interaction between components (perhaps that of mutually reflecting
monads, per Leibniz).  In support of these allusions, a quote of
Alexander from /TNO/: it “may be best if we redefine the concept of God
in a way that is more directly linked to the concept of ‘the whole.’”
This sounds a lot like Spinoza!
# [fn:: Cf. cite:lord2020 for more on the theme of Spinoza and architecture.]
# [fn:: The alchemical symbol for verdigris, and the planetary symbol for Earth.]
# [fn:: Cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peripheral]

Can obtain some useful [[DISTANCE][DISTANCE]] by thinking about how different kinds
of wholeness are associated with different symbols. In terms of
metaphors, we have already encountered overt images like that of
Chartres cathedral.  If we allow ourselves to explore further afield,
other symbols of wholeness come to mind: these include the circle, the
cross — or potentially the cross inside a circle,
\begingroup\alch\symbol{"3B}\endgroup.
Related but more
elaborated symbols include the circle with a cross rising above it
(\varTerra) which is both the modern astronomical symbol for Earth and
also linked with the Carthusian order, and the Rod of Asclepius
(\Asclepius, for the deity associated with healing or making whole) —
this last symbol sometimes being inter-confused with the Caduceus
(\Caduceus, the symbol of Hermes, the deity associated with mediation
of various forms, and also echoed in the planetary symbol for Mercury,
\begingroup\alch\symbol{"53}\endgroup).

These symbols are useful map-markers for the landscape we are
exploring.  In short, the pattern discourse seems to be drawn to /both/
major traditions of wholeness: and also to seek to unite them.  We get
the idea of unfolding in /APL/ and other pattern languages that work in
a top-down manner: however, we also get the notion of patterns and
principles that are generative of emergent phenomena.  As we mentioned
above, at this level, architecture and programming were seen, by
Alexander cite:alexander1999a, to unite: here pointing in the
direction of bio-hacking and nanotechnology (e.g., for molecular
self-assembly)
— at least at the allusive level if not at the concrete level.
The following quote suggests we are on a fruitful track:
#+begin_quote
Generative patterns work indirectly; they work on the underlying
structure of a problem (which may not be manifest in the problem)
rather than attacking the problem directly.[fn:: https://wiki.c2.com/?GenerativePattern]
#+end_quote

Clearly, another key metaphor in the discourse is the metaphor of /a language/:
#+begin_quote
... as in the case of natural languages, the pattern language is
generative. It not only tells us the rules of arrangement, but shows
us how to construct arrangements - as many as we want - which satisfy
the rules. (at /ibid./, quoting from /The Timeless Way Of Building/, pp. 185-6)
#+end_quote
Indeed, the prominence of linguistic metaphors reminds us that
Alexander’s writing contains many further traces of symbols associated
with Hermes:
#+begin_quote
In the house, [Hermes’] place is at the door, protecting the
threshold... He could be found around city gates, intersections, state
borders, and tombs (the gateways to the other world). cite:benvenuto1993hermes
#+end_quote
At the time when Hermes was actively embraced as a deity, in
some traditions he was paired with Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, whose “domain
was internal, the closed, the fixed, the inward” (/ibid./).  The discourse
around patterns certainly contains aspects a movement “to archaic
roots” present in other 20th Century thought: but unlike some of
these, patterns methods are apparently working to restore “the
dialectic between centripetal immobility and centrifugal mutation.”
One aspect of this is a movement towards foundations (in the form of
fundamental principles, per /TNO/): these are associated with Hestia.
The resolution within pattern language — as a form — seems to be along
Nietzschean lines: “anything that is becoming returns” (i.e., is
discussable as pattern), and “contingency resolves itself into
necessity” (i.e., the wholeness of generativity ultimately recovers the wholeness
of unfolding).[fn:: For further reflections on Nietzsche and wholeness, see cite:bishop2020holistic.]

* Discussion
<<Discussion>>

We now have in hand a case study that uses [[PLACARD][PLACARD]] as a unified whole,
together with a deep dive into design patterns via CLA.  The benefit
of taking that deep dive is that we have gained a new perspective on
how design patterns work in practice and illustrated the complexity
that underpins the model.  Now, we would like to reflect on why
putting these methods together makes such a big difference.  To do
this, we begin by examining a specific problem domain to which CLA and
DPL have been applied separately.

Anthropogenic climate change is a situation of major global concern in
the early 21st Century.  It comes as no surprise that it has been
examined separately by proponents of both CLA and DPL.  We use this
recent history to frame future work building on the case study and
analysis developed above.

In an overview on =theconversation.com=, Cameron Tonkinwise and Abby
Mellick Lopes write:
#+begin_quote
A design pattern is first an observation: “People in that kind of designed situation tend to do this sort of thing”. It is then possible to design an intervention that redirects those tendencies. If that intervention succeeds, it can become a recommended pattern to help other designers: “If you encounter this kind of situation, try to make these kinds of interventions” cite:theconversation2021.
#+end_quote
They amplify the ‘ethical’ aspect of their thinking:
#+begin_quote
... the patterns we are talking about, context-specific interactions
between people and things, are more like habits. They are tendencies
that lead to repeated actions.
#+end_quote
The 41 patterns they have developed include examples like \textsc{The Night-Time Commons},[fn:: https://www.coolingthecommons.com/pattern%20deck/]
which:
#+begin_quote
... might shift daytime activities into cooler night times.  Some
places already have these patterns: night markets and night-time use
of outdoor spaces.  If locally adapted versions of these patterns
encourage people to adopt new habits, other patterns will be needed.
These will include, for example, ways to remind those cooling off
outdoors in the evening that others might be trying to sleep with
their naturally ventilating windows open.  Such interlinked patterns
point to the way pattern thinking moves from the big scale to the
small.
#+end_quote
Reading this, we were concerned that, while the Cooling the Commons patterns
do acknowledge “horizontal complexity” — namely, through interlinked patterns —
the process does not deal with the “vertical complexity” coming from
the fact that diurnal rhythms are deeply embedded in biology and
culture.  People have cultural beliefs about what are appropriate
activities for different times of day.  Public and domestic rituals
are organized about the daily cycle.  Times of day have symbolic
associations.  As far as we could tell, these authors focused on
more or less technical issues at the systems level, and did not acknowledge these
issues at the worldview and myth levels.  A more comprehensive
approach might, for instance, re-examine rituals to see which of them
relate to the phenomenon of sunrise versus the act of getting up and
starting the day, and then figuring out how to adapt these rituals to a new
schedule.  A suitable research strategy might be study how practices changed in
the past and adapted to new circumstances, such as industrialization
with its clockwork regimentation of the day.

Meanwhile, cite:HEINONEN2017101 discuss a CLA game that developed four
different scenarios in small groups.  The four scenarios were “Radical
Startups”, “Value-Driven Techemoths”, “Green DIY Engineers” and “New
Consciousness”.  As groups worked through the CLA for each scenario,
they developed a range of new ideas.  How would these have collated
with the patterns developed by Tonkinwise and Lopes and colleagues?
Might players have spotted ways in which the patterns would conflict
with deeper values — or ways in which they might be exploited to cause
chaos in the city cite:friction2016a?

Broadening our exploration of how design patterns relate to futures
studies, we should mention Schwartz cite:schwartz1996a (Appendix,
pp. 241-248), /viz./, his “Steps to Developing Scenarios”.  This process
follows an outline with a striking similarity to a design pattern
template.  Both Alexander and Schwartz advocate the identification of
driving forces in a context.  However, unlike Alexander, Schwartz does
not intend to resolve conflicts between the forces within a
harmonising design.  On the contrary, the aim in the scenario
development method is to understand how these forces might evolve and
lead to diverse scenarios.  As scenarios develop, they can serve as
the ground for developing new design work in Alexander’s sense.  In
the foregoing sections, we used a method from future studies to think
about design patterns.  We think that design patterns can be useful
inside scenarios, and also used to scaffold the design and evolution of
scenarios.

With this in mind, here are four scenarios that will be of
interest to DPL practitioners, roughly pegged to the four
layers of CLA.  We should emphasise that these scenarios are
not mutually exclusive.

** Scenario I. Patterns become explicitly computational.
Patterns have periodically been discussed in explicitly computational
terms — however, that direction of work so far remains mostly at the
level of a proposal cite:alexander1999a,moran1971a, with limited
discipline-specific uptake within architectural design
cite:jacobus2009a,OXMAN1994141.  Could this change?  We wonder if
design patterns — and related designs for Ostrom-style institutions
cite:ostrom2009a (p. 11) — should be brought onto a similar
computational footing, and included in the computational mix within
climate modelling software.  These developments might be accompanied
by more mathematical precision along the lines of [[FORMAL PATTERNS][FORMAL PATTERNS]],
e.g., drawing on and moving beyond computational paradigms such as
contract-based programming and the Semantic Web.  While a program
specification can reveal a lot about the program’s operating context,
a /formal pattern/ would have to respond to a conflict in the context,
which requires a suitably formal notion of conflict.  One strategy
would be to think of design patterns as conceptual blends
cite:corneliPatternsDesign2018; different blends would have different
possible and incompossible worlds associated with them.
For example, the Cooling the Commons pattern language includes
\textsc{Community Library} as one of its patterns; the library blends
a learning space with cool refuge, and must balance their provisions
against cost and effort.  If the library was blended with a
\textsc{Writers Workshop}, it could become a place for the community
to generate knowledge about further adaptive strategies.  However, this could conflict with the notion of
library contents as being read-only, or with the view that libraries
should be silent study spaces.  Could these ideas and complexities be
reasoned about computationally?

** Scenario II. Pattern language authoring communities move to free/libre/open source licensing.
In the field of policy, ‘adaptive capacity’ describes a society’s
ability to recover after a shock
cite:thonicke2020advancing,magnan2010better.
This in turn is linked with the health and adaptivity of the society’s
institutions cite:fidelman2017institutions.  As we saw earlier,
innovation conflicts with consistency and efficacy — however,
innovation in fact may be a necessary response to other ongoing
environmental changes.  Mehaffy and coauthors worked with Ward
Cunningham to make their book /A New Pattern Language for Growing
Regions/ cite:mehaffy2020new into a wiki, [[http://npl.wiki][npl.wiki]], which is licensed
under CC BY-SA 4.0.  Will other pattern developers follow suit and
move to open licensing — and suitable infrastructures for working with open contents?

# add refs to reproducible research papers
# add refs to Minnesota 2050 paper
# Maybe add a comment saying these people were ‘sort of’ working together (in different rooms)

** Scenario III. PLACARD scaffolds new literacies of collaboration.

As we’ve seen in our work with Emacs and Peeragogy — and previously with PlanetMath cite:krowne2003,corneli-thesis —
projects need a lot more than simply access to source code in order to
thrive.  We see a link to the topic of reproducible research.  Above
and beyond the immediate technical considerations cite:sandve2013ten,
we think that something is “reproducible” if it is teachable to
someone new!  We’ve found Org Mode (and literate programming in
general) to be useful for this.  At the same time, collaboration
across different skill sets is challenging.  One reason we need
additional scaffolding would be familiar to the protagonists of our
pizza story: “Innovation foils attempts to be consistent and
efficient” cite:tan2020uncertainty (p. 12).  Adapting to climate
change won’t work if we only do business as usual.  In the Minnesota
2050 project, participants were selected from a variety of professions
and leadership roles to produce scenarios for energy and land use, and
combined modelling with scenario planning cite:olabisi2010.  However,
actually solving large-scale problems together in interdisciplinary
teams will require new thinking and additional tools: to bridge
between the viewpoints of, e.g., professional futurists, programmers,
data scientists, local farmers — and to draw on the insights of
citizen scientists cite:wildschut2017a.

** Scenario IV. Patterns eat Big Tech.
Reflecting on the increasingly contextual and transdisciplinary
nature of the discussions at PLoP and other venues, along with
the other points above, brings to mind Hesse’s /The Glass Bead
Game/.  This reference can help tie these points together at the
level of myth, metaphor, and narrative:
#+begin_quote
... the narrator informs us that the Game is like a universal
language: a way of connecting traditions and cultures from both the
East and the West and of playing with all disciplines and
values. cite:roberts2007conscientisation
#+end_quote
For those who are familiar with the novel, this reference also
suggests: proceed with caution.  How hierarchical do we want
our community, or our society, to be?  How critical are we
capable of being towards the tenets we hold dear?  When
reflecting on futures-oriented discourses, Slaughter described
a spectrum: “participatory and open at one
pole and closed (or professionalised) at the other”
cite:SLAUGHTER1989447.  In /The Glass Bead Game/, everyone is
able to play, but only some become excellent.  Related issues
show up in our current technological culture
cite:unger2019knowledge — how do they show up in the cultures
we might envision?  With due care patterns might become the basis
of widespread technical literacies, not for an elite group of
hackers or for a few highly-paid rockstars, but for everyone.

# maybe reference the Bloom’s 2 Sigma problem here
# Only half of the students will make it to the end of the course and only half of those get A’s

** Summary

# Need to recap Alexander 1999 at some point

In 1999, Alexander talked about “the generation of a living world”
cite:alexander1999a.  From the vantage point of 2021, we cannot afford
to take these remarks as mere metaphor.  Neither can we afford blythe
techno-optimism, nor to confine our thinking to one domain, be it
built environment, software, or philosophy.  Our /vision for change/ —
now speaking as part of the design pattern community — is that the
four scenarios we described above will be given serious thought.
/Progress/ will become measurable through markers of debate and perhaps
through ensuing trial-and-error uptake or adaptation of the methods
we’ve described.

*** Methodological contribution
PARs are related to patterns, in that they describe a context, and
surface problems and solutions that arise or are likely to arise in
that context.  They might be seen as a template for proto-patterns.
However, they do not necessarily have a strong repeating aspect.  CLA
could be seen to play the opposite role to PARs.  Metaphorically, CLA
integrates the tangent vectors that characterise the observations we
have gathered as we work together, and can be used to reconstruct the
shared meaning of our work.  DPL, then, can turn this understanding
into practical high-level plans.  By contextualising DPL with the
other methods, we avoid brittle solutions and enrich our thinking.

*** Constructively critical contribution
If the ideas and methods we have examined were actively used and
improved jointly by all of the different communities whose work we
have drawn on, many things could start to move quickly.
- The Emacs Research Group can use these ideas to help connect with potential stakeholders.
- The Peeragogy network can help facilitate some of the discussions and projects.
- PLoP can provide relevant social infrastructure and connections with others using pattern methods.
- As we gather further evidence, we can return to the futures community and share what we learned with them, and expand the scale and scope of the integrated effort.

* Related work
<<Related_Work>>

We are certainly not the only people to think about systems and
futures: what is distinctive about this paper is that we’ve connected
these domains with the design pattern terminology and methods.  The
individual methods we described have various analogies (e.g., between
PAR and AAR, or \textsc{Daily Scrum}, as noted above; one could also
point to Architectural Decision Records[fn:: https://adr.github.io/]
and other review tools).  The work as a whole has some analogies with
a method called Causal Layered Synthesis developed by Paul Wildman
cite:wildman2010engaging.  Ultimately, connecting this sort of work
with patterns can help to put these disparate strands of thought on a
coherent basis.

To further our understanding, we begin this section by engaging
potential criticisms.  Some prominent critical voices have been
introduced above.  To recapitulate, Dawes and Ostwald provided a
comprehensive view of criticisms of DPL; Tidwell questioned the
non-user-centredness of much DPL discourse; VanDrunen focused on
potential friction or incompatibilities at the worldview level between
mob software and other cultures; Gene Demby and Ashe Dryden discussed
how the openness of FLOSS isn’t actually open to all in the same way
by default.  We can broaden out somewhat further, to reveal further
tensions.

- Shaw and Hill cite:shaw2014 talk about how commons-based peer
  production is not necessarily egalitarian, so, even if DPL was to
  move to FLOSS model, we would expect to see cultural winners and
  losers.
- In a related critique, our collaborator Paola Ricaurte pointed out
  that an approach to peer production that centres European and North
  American designers, while ignoring local communities and
  relationships, is potentially just another form of rehashed
  colonialism.

To expand on this point: we can position the broader orientation of our work as a
counterposition to cite:kostakisDesignGlobalManufacture2015 who argued
for a development model based on “thinking global and producing
local.”  At the centre of their vision is a global pool of designs,
which are put into production in local Fab Lab facilities.  By
contrast, the [[PLACARD][PLACARD]] pattern centres local circumstances and
histories (via PARs and CLA-linked methods like [[GENEALOGY][GENEALOGY]]).  We would
expect to see varied knowledge bases develop, that are rich with
cultural diversity and human relationships.  [[PLACARD][PLACARD]] methods could
flips the Kostakis et al. formula on its head: patterns are primarily
tools for thinking locally about particular contexts, individual
relationships, conflicts and circumstances; CLA puts them in context,
and PAR keeps this system up to date.  However, only secondarily and
potentially does this lead to anything resembling a shared global
resource.  More likely, the methods we’ve described would simply
strengthen local forms of resilience and better identify healthy
futures.

That said, this line of thinking leads us to ask if — at the heart of
the methods we’ve discussed and despite everyone’s good intentions to
be multicultural and transdisciplinary in their approach and
multivalently accessible and accommodating in their development —
there is a form of hegemonic power asserting itself inside the methods
we’ve described.  After all, the notion of gift culture has been
critiqued on that basis cite:Mallard2019; would we expect
pattern-theoretic or free software culture to be exempt?  Furthermore,
supposing that patterns (and software) are indeed tools for liberating
many human tendencies.  Humans also — individually and collectively —
have tendencies to self-destruction, murder, exploitation, and
wantonness; presumably we need discourses that help tip the balance
against those tendencies.

Having raised these concerns we certainly will not reject them out of
hand, rather, we suggest that the philosophical and cultural issues
around patterns need further thought.  This underscores our broader
point that thinking about how patterns — and other methods — should be
done contextually.  That dovetails with our next point, which is to
briefly examine how this work relates to a somewhat similar agenda
developed by Christopher Alexander himself.

We can begin by drawing the reader's attention to two diagrams from
Alexander's "Notes on the Synthesis of Form", recopied below as Figure
\ref{synthesis-diagrams}.  Parts A.-C. of this figure have two columns
corresponding to context (/sive/ problem) and form (/sive/ solution), and
one, two, or three rows, corresponding to the "actual world", "mental
picture" and "formal picture".  A design problem is posed at the level
of the actual world, say, "build a house atop this hill" or "make a
celebration song".

The design problem can be solved at one of the three levels.  The most
direct approach is to work in the actual world.  For instance, a
musician might pick up an instrument, start playing something, try out
different possibilities, modify notes or phrasings to make it sound
better, and so come up with a song.

At the level of "mental picture", a designer receives design
requirements which describe the problem, and produces a plan which
describes a solution.  For instance, the host of the party might make
a request "Write a joyous song for alto voice accompanied by flute and
trumpet to celebrate the acceptance of our paper into the conference."
A composer might then sit down at a desk, away from any instruments,
and write out a score which would later be handed to the singer and
instrumentalists for performance.  Alexander points out that there is a
danger in this process: the composer would no longer have the
immediate feedback which comes from working directly in the actual
world.  Accordingly, the result might be a song that matches the
description, but doesn’t match the mood of the event.

Alexander’s proposed solution is to produce a formal picture of the
mental picture, and instead work with that formal picture.  For our
example, it might take the form of a suitably elaborate music theory,
one that includes concepts like  ‘\emph{ballabile}’ (to indicate that
the song should be danceable).  More generally, we employ a suitable
metalanguage to reason about the mental representation; this process
of reasoning can then take the place of feedback from the actual world
in guiding and evaluating our designs.  For Alexander, this consists
of a set-theoretic formalization of design requirements and potential
misfits.\footnote{Incidentally: why only three rows here?  According to G\"odel, any language that can count can also serve as its own metalanguage.}

Figure \ref{synthesis-diagrams}D. refers to the process of design once
we have arrived at the "formal picture" level.  The left panel
represents the analytic process in which one decomposes a design
problem into subproblems and the right panel represents the
complementary synthetic process in which one successively combines
solutions to subproblems to arrive at a solution to the original
problem.  Alexander proposed a maximum entropy method for carrying out
the analysis and, in later works, introduced design patterns for use
in the synthesis; and ultimately, described 15 principles that could
guide a design at an even more abstract level.

In this paper, we have considered the problems faced by groups of
people organizing their activities.  The naive "actual world" approach
(A.) would be when a group takes a "seat of the pants" approach to
dealing with issues as they come up in the course of work.  PAR, or,
better yet, PAR and CLA together as in our case study, can be used to
sketch a "mental picture".  CLA and DPL are, respectively, techniques
for analysis and synthesis at the "formal picture" level.  Just as
even a talented musician without a solid grasp of music theory would
be hard pressed to compose an augmentation canon or symphony, so too
we suggest that a group which faces complex challenges may want to
consider these as techniques for orchestrating its activities.

* Conclusion
<<Conclusion>>
We conclude with a PAR for the paper as a whole.
\bigskip

\noindent
*1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?*
- Our intention was to apply the CLA method from future studies to
  design pattern theory, in order to provide a methodologically
  salient perspective on the future of pattern theory.
- Within the Emacs Research Group, we used PARs, CLA, and DPL to manage our work, and we shared a description that process and its results as a case study here.
- And to make sense of how these things connect with each other —
  practically, to show how causal layered analysis could work
  synergistically with pattern theory.
*2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?*
- We introduced our methods and illustrative case study, then took a deep dive into patterns.
- We connected our observations with some broader literature on future studies and proposed scenarios describing ways in which design patterns might evolve.
*3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?*
- JC: These different communities need to be talking to each other.
- RP: One of our goals was to make the connection between futures and patterns.  We could have discussed earlier some scenarios for the paper, like “what if it doesn’t get published?”  We could have had a meeting way back in May or June where we looked at scenarios.  We could take the scenarios above and use them to start building out a set of further scenarios for ERG, peeragogy, and so on.
- CD: Keep in mind that these are patterns people but not CLA people: we should make sure that we have presented CLA in a way that they grasp.
- CP: /Fearless Change/ is related work in connection with the Futures stuff.  You need things like this as projects develop over time to understand what’s going on.  I feel more access to this paper than our previous writing topics on this topic.
- LV: I’m glad everyone is on board in reviewing the paper. The diverse views of contributors provides some wealth because people are discovering things in different ways.  We’ve nicely modularised the pattern of reviewing a paper, and brought different gazes that can only lead to more wealth and appreciation.
- NA: Hi folx I'm still a bit disoriented with the jet lag, enjoy the break and see y'all in August!
*4. What did we learn or change?*
- Relative to earier attempts to describe patterns to the futures community, this work is more mature.
- It is a fitting third installation to round out Joe’s “Patterns” trilogy cite:corneli2015a,Corneli2018.
- Our methods are compatible with the ideas described by Christopher Alexander, and a lot more detail about how these methods can be applied to the activities of an organisation.
- There’s a whole behind the scenes, there’s a lot of heart and soul here that could make it more like joint autobiography.
*5. What else should we change going forward?*
- We believe we have an answer to Alexander’s question.  We’re not sure he’ll like it.  The ‘Chartres of programming’ has been hidden in plain view all along.  Alejandro Jodorowsky refers to the Marseilles Tarot as a “nomadic cathedral” cite:jodorowsky2009way (p. 10); pattern languages are very much the same sort of thing.  This is a project of at least a lifetime if not more.

\appendix
* APPENDIX: Patterns
<<appendix>>

[[DECONSTRUCTION]]-[[REORDERING KNOWLEDGE]] are direct adaptations of Inayattulah’s Poststructural Futures Toolkit cite:inayatullah1998b to the pattern format.  [[FORMAL PATTERNS]]-[[DIVERSITY]] elaborate new patterns surfaced by ERG for inclusion in the Peeragogy Handbook.  The patterns are referred to within the text using all-caps.
** DECONSTRUCTION
<<DECONSTRUCTION>>

- *Context*: A text: here meaning anything that can be critiqued — a movie, a book, a worldview, a person — something or someone that can be read.  (/NB./, every text has a /context/: much like every pattern has a context.)
- *Problem*: The existence of a ‘text’ suggests a *conflict* between (1) the notion of truth embedded in that text, and (2) the text itself as historically situated or positioned within relationships of power.
- *Solution*: We break apart the text’s components, asking what is visible and what is invisible? Who or what is privileged within or by the text? Which assumptions does the text make preferable?  How is ‘truth’ produced within the text?  Who is silenced?  In this way, we ‘deconstruct’ the universality of the text and show its contingent nature.

# LV: It feels like this is full-circle back to Sapir-Whorf where the language you speak frames how you think... if language is supposed to be the trace of our cognition, and have an input on how you think — the way we use or modify idioms is telling of how culture manifests itself into language & language manifests into cognition.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
\noindent
*Example* The technique of _deconstruction_ examines how a
text is constructed and often does this by evoking the contingencies and potential
arbitrariness of symbols in language.  In
our pizza example, we have the book on running a business.  When the couple
revisited it critically, they noted some peculiarities of the language.
For instance, the book routinely divided people into winners and
losers, even in contexts which had nothing much to do with
competition.  The upshot of this was that the couple came away with
the impression that the language of the book, the way it talks about social
organisation, and the way it itself organized
the material embodied a worldview at odds with their values.  By
seeking advice in this book indiscriminately, they were unwittingly
following the implicit worldview, leading to frustration
and confusion.

** GENEALOGY
<<GENEALOGY>>

- *Context*: History is not just the passage of time, but an unfolding of different positions. We consider a /concept/ or /idea/ to be historically situated in this sense.
- *Problem*: Within history, certain discourses have been hegemonic. A given term or concept will have developed through varied discourses: this observation *conflicts* with a naive notion of terms or concepts as simply ‘given’ or universally true.
- *Solution*: One takes a word or concept, looks at the way it
  has been understood and interpreted in different eras, and
  how these different understandings came about.  We ask: which
  discourses have been victorious in constituting the present?
  How have they travelled through history? What have been the
  points in which the issues have become important or
  contentious?  By tracing the evolution of a given term or
  concept through periods of identity or sameness, and through
  periods of difference or divergence, we come face-to-face
  with its generative potential.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
\noindent
*Example*   On a personal
scale, we have Mom's notion of "restaurant".  When she was small, a
restaurant was a magical place where her family would go on special
occasions.  When she grew up, a restaurant was a place to socialize
with friends and meet new people.  Lately, it has been synonymous with
balance sheets, market share, supply chains, and customer
satisfaction.  She wonders how such a thorough change happened
so fast and whether she could recover some aspects of the earlier
understandings into the current context.
#+END_COMMENT

** DISTANCE
<<DISTANCE>>

- *Context*: The present.
- *Problem*: The present seems ‘normal’, but this *conflicts* with any impetus to change.
- *Solution*: We ask: which scenarios make the present remarkable?  Make it unfamiliar? Denaturalize it?  Where are these scenarios, e.g., are they in historical space — the futures that could have been — or in present or future space? By establishing a sense of distance from the present, we can return to explore the present from a different point of view.  We are more likely to see the ever-changing character of the present, points of leverage, and how to use them.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
\noindent
*Example* As long as our couple was in the thick
of things, running the shop and fixing one problem after another, they
couldn't really see what was going on, only feel uneasy.  In order to
interpret their situation, they needed to create some mental space by
bringing in other possibilities.  After a conversation where they
explored other restaurants they had known, recalled how things were in
the past, thought of ways they thought things might have gone better
or worse but didn't, they returned to the current situation and found
themselves noticing all sorts of things which hitherto they had been
taking for granted.

** ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES
<<ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES>>

- *Context*: The past that we see as truth is in fact the particular writing of history: it is a text amenable to [[DECONSTRUCTION][DECONSTRUCTION]].  The futures that we are ‘given’ are, similarly, only some of the ones that are in-principle-possible due to the evolutionary nature of concepts exposed by their [[GENEALOGY][GENEALOGY]].
- *Problem*: The past and future are put to use within discourse, resulting in some winners and some losers.  The results we see may *conflict* with our sense of what we would prefer to have happen.
- *Solution*: With this technique, one notes how and why some
  interpretations of the past and visions of the future have
  been promoted whilst others have been suppressed. We ask:
  which interpretation of the past is valorized?  What histories
  make the present problematic?  Which vision of the future is
  used to maintain the present?  Alternatively, which visions
  undo the unity of the present?

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
\medskip
\noindent
*Example*  Based upon his
daily readings of old-time New Englanders, Pop realizes that the view
of history as an inexorably steady march of economic and technical
progress leaves a lot out of the picture.  If so much was left out of
our recall of the past, what aspects of the present are being ignored and
what potential futures are being dismissed?  This line of questioning inspires
Pop to rethink the restaurant as a modern-day Walden cabin in which they
commune with nature for one half of the week and commune with their
neighbors for the other half of the week.

** REORDERING KNOWLEDGE
<<REORDERING KNOWLEDGE>>
- *Context*: Trends and problems are emergent, historical, and political: they are embedded in complex webs of becoming.
- *Problem*: It’s not always obvious how to move /between/ the ‘layers’ mentioned above. This *conflicts* with any given effort to empower oneself with a deeper understanding of the situation.
- *Solution*: We ask: how does the ordering of knowledge differ across civilization, gender and episteme? What or Who is othered? How does it denaturalize current orderings, making them peculiar instead of universal? What tools can we use to reorder knowledge, to make it available in new forms without necessarily requiring the same historical baggage?

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
\noindent
*Example*
In the technique of _reordering knowledge_, one asks what principles
have been used to organize knowledge, what are the implications to
this, and what are alternatives.  In rereading their books, our couple
notes that they are organized about a framework of impersonal market
forces.  This reinforces a dog-eat-dog view of the world which, in
turn, rationalizes profiteering and hypercompetition.  Thus, the
couple decides to re-organize the patterns for running a business in a
people-centric manner where markets are but one type of social
institution amongst many.
#+end_COMMENT

** FORMAL PATTERNS
<<FORMAL PATTERNS>>

- *Context*: In our work with project- and change-management
  \textsc{Technologies} across a widely distributed \textsc{Community}.
- *Problem*: Using patterns, todo items, CLA, and PARs in an intuitive
  manner is clearly workable at a small scale, but could become
  chaotic when we scale up; this *conflicts* with our perspective that
  these methods can be applied broadly.
- *Solution*: Can we develop a more mathematically precise way to
  describe this set of tools?  We might build on the earlier work of
  Corneli et al. cite:Corneli2018 which describes patterns as
  /conceptual blends/.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
\noindent
*Example*

** SERENDIPITY
<<SERENDIPITY>>
- *Context*: Within an ongoing research and development project.
- *Problem*: The idea of planning *conflicts* with our experience that
  reliance on plans can produce rigid behaviour and a corresponding
  brittleness.
- *Solution*: We adapt our plans to increase our /general/ preparedness, and adapt our strategy to decrease our reliance on accurate /forecasting/. This operationalises the ‘serendipity pattern’ described by Merton.[fn:: “The serendipity pattern refers to the fairly common experience of observing an unanticipated, anomalous and strategic datum which becomes the occasion for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory… ” cite:merton1948bearing, reprinted in cite:merton.]

** RECOMMENDER
<<RECOMMENDER>>
- *Context*: Within our use of \textsc{Technologies} and materials we
  could \textsc{Reduce, reuse, recycle}.
- *Problem*: As the body of content grows, it can be harder to find
  relevant material or the best collaborators in a global pool: this
  *conflicts* with our desire to achieve excellence.
- *Solution*: New software that can help surface relevant
  material and opportunities would be useful.  Existing
  implementations include “scrobbling” audio tracks to Last.fm,
  or buying recommended products on Amazon.  The same ideas can
  be adapted to free/libre/open source contents, research,
  learning, and other domains.

#+end_COMMENT

** DIVERSITY
<<DIVERSITY>>
- *Context*: Within a \textsc{Project}.
- *Problem*: If we only collaborate within a relatively homogeneous
  population of people who think like us this *conflicts* with our
  desire to find new ideas and new solutions, and to make things that
  are widely useful.
- *Solution*: Look out for different contexts in which we can   collaborate with different people; they don’t all have to work on   the same project.  We recognise that collaboration is easier when we   share similar languages and literacies.  In cases where   collaboration needs to be made tighter, prefer ways of exchanging   information and expertise with \textsc{Newcomers} that makes the   relationship one of peers rather than a one-way hierarchy.  Understand the historical landscape through techniques like [[ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES][ALTERNATIVE PASTS AND FUTURES]]. At the same time, by inviting people who were not closely connected or emotionally invested in your   project, you can get the advantages of [[DISTANCE][DISTANCE]], at least vicariously.  Diversity may be absent for contingent historical reasons, rather than as a design principle, e.g., within   free software only about 5% of the participants are female, whereas   women occupy around 25% of computing occupations cite:Vedres2019.
