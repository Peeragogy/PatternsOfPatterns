\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this paper is to show how we can combine and adapt
methods from elite training, future studies, and
collaborative design, and apply them to address significant problems
in distributed peer-to-peer networks.  We focus on three such methods:
we use Action Reviews to implement social perception, Causal Layered
Analysis to implement social cognition, and Design Pattern Languages
to implement social action.  To illustrate the methods in combination,
we first develop a case study, showing how we applied them to
bootstrap a distributed cross-disciplinary research seminar.  We then
use Causal Layered Analysis to explore the ways in which the design
pattern discourse has been evolving.  Building on these analyses, we
elaborate several scenarios for the future use of design patterns in
large-scale distributed collaboration.  We conclude that the
combination of methods is robust to uncertainty and that they can help
people coming from different backgrounds work together.  In
particular, we show how methods drawn from other domains enrich and
are enriched by design patterns; we believe the analysis will be of
interest to all of the communities whose methods we draw upon.
